played previous ghost warrior sniper elite games favourite one pros sniping mechanics different rifles scopes elevation wind etc music sound effects game really really shines setting georgia mountains really cool unique storyline bit cheesy liked nonetheless well balanced difficulties runs well medhigh old gtx rig ultra new gtx rig save system bad everyone says cons side missions mess sometimes disappearing start mission marker lack map pointers targets body armor seems overpowered heavy soldiers tanking bullets chest weapons clearly better others choose best best
played hour thats noticed serious frames per second drops gtx graphics even maxed enemies respawning without end painful targeting system awkward controls voice acting meh
pros storyline rpg elements level design multitude sidequests interesting character development fun combat climatic music optimisation runs stable frames per second high settings old rig gtx cons lots loading zones especially towards end game hated nogravity zones maybe thats lot replay value explore almost everything one go pro actually nothing else really
great
amazing game best civil war strategy ever pros gameplay army management customizing units commanders epic battles rpg elements battle records every unit graphics ui music tons climate bugs great performance played gtx years old intel proc k resolution graphics maxed experienced zero problems hours cons starting missions really bad almost stopped playing point sometimes battles heavily scripted forcing play missions twice one time figure second time actually beat looks easy actually quite hard figure learn units battle pacing terrain etc last union mission atrocious
fix game ill fix review gave abouth th freeze one game
enjoyed lot although napoleonic era admittedly least favourite military period good strategic level really shines tactical battles level challenging never unfair battles change rapidly got im back got minutes recommend playing hard least normal level ironman played russia hard managed first try although got lucky number times also recommend reading manual least part battles important know modifiers behind rolls bit shame cant play england makes sense gameplay asymmetry perspective interface allright graphics music bugs experienced thumb
fun little game initial bad experiences nuts battle bulge buggy unplayable battle tallarn plain bad one pleasant suprise pros appeal people like boardgames card games ww preferably mentioned havent encountered bugs fun play long coffe break pretty supports resolutions p interface allright cons price little steep small game youre going play multi hours single player content max bit luck dependant cause drawing bad cards initial hand cost game cards could use bigger variety
riddled bugs literally unplayable
cool game
potentially great game bogged terrible mechanic choices game real time quests time limits natural habit try complete quests fast effective one could game requires stalling quests long possible progress certain game events later impossible know beforehand though either savescum like crazy play mechanics game cheese way great shame cause game potential better version papers please weird time management choices forcing replay certain sequences search perfect activities rotation killed
good oh pretty
freakin love
good
pros lots single player content large campaigns stages war concept neat story missions fun clearly different air combat real eye candy ccg elements unit unlocks leveling units commanders tech trees art graphics cons loading times game ocassionally start stuttering reason infantry seems really underpowered
last chapter game riddled bugs disappearing items prevent finishing game also terrible plot holes inconsistencies point whole story make sense finishing game say sorely disappointed want play good detective game favor buy sherlock holmes crimes punishement
charming little game
multiplayer experience youve disconnected server youve disconnected server youve disconnected server perhaps great works cant tell single player experience utterly dissapointing campaigns missions play allies substract german missions gives missions total doesnt matter cause gave already glorified skirmishes secondary objectives micromanagement hell prime overall expecting another great wargame different setting sadly different game much much worse predecessors graphics ugly red dragon eye candy
expected solid squad building tactical game got easily one best rpgs played years gaming career im simply amazed good game artstyle atmosphere mechanics storyline quests everything old school best possible way even made non player character actually care one games kills inner powergamer makes roleplay recruit people like instead ones need beef dps charts even resolve quest satisfying manner instead taking economical xpgolditems gain approach someone tell wont make games like old times anymore slap face give game cant praise high enough
mix ccg world tanks progression system despite real time strategy wins reflexes game sessions short intensive enjoyable game
im huge fan zombie genre really like game dungeon crawler rpg youravaragezombieshooter bit similar darkest dungeon thumb
actually decent game crude package huge world tons quests suprisingly deep mechanics lots old world climate dont bounce first bad impression youll find legit fun warhammer title
game horrible cant stand cant even force write proper review ill point random stupidities chapter master terminator armour tripple sommersaults like rey mysterio jumping air like hes songo dragonball z chapter master literally meters tall fuck thats cant rebind camera keys wsad prepare use arrow keys like die mission cant load either restart mission go back main menu moba bad inquisitor cliche imperial guards speaking chapter master like hes random dude youre finally damn time laughing loud wut writers clearly clue wk lore everyone looks like christmas tree
great great great
finished game im sorely disappointed pros art style beautiful locations eyecandy concept game great combat actually bad everyone claims mix rpg strategy cons plot storytelling terrible youve got choice control whatsoever character game linear tells also tells think im kidding breaks hope immersion ever enjoy playing character kills woman children priests slaves etc completely dont care vikings banner saga vikings didnt sadly game gives choice matter well game riddled bugs blackscreens freezes crashes amazing came early access performance loading times abysmal run title frames yet get second freezes trying anything mechanics plain simple broken wanty upgrade ship well bad none villages sells tin copper year swim money random number generator tells nothing nothing perhaps next year next year oh ffs doesnt really matter cause game one difficulty setting easy win always everyone matter classes terribly imbalanced well fact two assault others aka useless class little number random events rehappen every year always good answer always painfully obvious one always one using century knowledge praying odin roleplaying viking yarl always wrong answer sadly love king dragon pass really really enjoyed banner sagas game nothing like avoid
loads text good storytelling longer description better description dialogue overflood nonsense words clever dialogue playing game makes feel like walking museum looking exhibits glass cases interact ultimately dont care next exhibits plate telling awesome thing see dont care game nothing like planescape pretentionus boring filled pseudophilosophic babble played hours felt like hours good game give exact opposite feeling
campaigns even beter great sengoku jidai
enjoyed lot great moderntactics game good balance fun realism multitude units big nonlinear scenarios decent storyline graphics good music really cool also quite difficult rewarding time
enjoyed lot really good actually pair previous de story well written locations interesting main protagonist cool music really good sidequests engaging fun dont care ingame purchases simply dont really dig cyberpunk europe feel game somehow similar shadowrundragonfall liked lot completely dont understand heat game generated
constant crashes prevent enjoying cool game
really wanted love game cant overall looks great tactical battles game core time weakest least fun part due weird design mechanics choices pros neat idea art graphics storytelling atmosphere cons combat mechanics poorly made risk management crazy dmg spikes random deployment random encouters ugly miniatures
brilliant
great game every race feels like scene action movie
charming fun

cute game frustrating times everything correct dumb ai bug messes everything wish game polished replayability borderline recommend due price id say skip unless sale maybe fixed bugs added review would change overall id say likely isnt worth
neat idea cool twists autobattler genre overall game fails lot ways type synergies gameplay feels pretty flat overall however could overlook biggest flaw unlock power future games mumbo jumbo shouldnt farm games get st nd place get affinity points unlock powers let people choose powers without grinding points every game independent another one persons success previous game shouldnt impact future games skill matter simply played games

factoriolite great abstraction basic mechanisms behind automation games like factorio interesting concepts sets apart largely pure automation loses points obvious missing features volume control sound music ability mirror every building type would neat challenges like parts cost place blueprints thing resource cost outside upgrading tech maybe challenges modes weird shapes building types would nice like maybe color subtraction add colortypes complex interactions overall really solid especially price dont take word check github since free open source would probably increase achievements challenges added difficulty

difficult taste present everywhere somehow reminds evil twin version spelunky items acquire dont even know seem proper descriptions eg ice immunity ice skates theres stuff like glove description bonk scourge mechanics everything learnt failing pretty much nothing told player top coop bugged need always add nd player v town separate room cant rerun bad could nice experience

literally risk rain fantastic combat
de facto benchmark
god tier action rogueliteroguelike
played destiny originally released campaign relatively fun took roughly hours complete reason play anymore levels removed whole game feels like sandbox create new character million things going everywhere dont really know sure could x whats really confusing lack campaign characters feels weird play strike get random characters discussing youve idea whats going isnt enjoyable purchase borderlands
really solid mechanics sense oldschoolness game failure mission force attempt missions take long time checkpoints wouldnt hurt dialogue teen drama everything voice acted great english japanese sfxs music suberb
great game mechanics pretty damn terrible tutorialization uxui ended uninstalling game felt way pay win although theres matchmaking based elo doesnt feel good matched vs similar elo lot better ships youre playing better dont feel still far fp games go one good ones eg world warships path exile mechwarrior online
fantastic roguelike splash darkest dungeon except youre dungeon sure balance though week attackers fled demoralization first monster wave single trap would issue game would continue great audio visuals player choice matters functional uxui works quickly effortlessly
better pubg yet still sad fuck enjoy kiddy shooters winner one enjoys hiding andor fire first andor generally hitscan shooters certainly players enjoy cod cs pubg etc im one played two solo rounds first game th uxui bugged showed full clip actually empty jumped person behind find could fire nd game st review uninstall
even long time since release pathfinder kingmaker experience still quite abysmal great lookingsounding game seems throw sticks gears joy making player suffer things game tell resting remove reduced attributes although tooltip attribute says resting clear resting randomly recovers eg one need base stats cast spells class item detail eg weapon qualities tooltips idea eg weapon finesse notice question game also crashed randomly enjoyed baldurs gates icewind dales tyranny pillars eternity didnt finish two though recommend
simple turn based card game simple taste

absolutely stunning hidden gem age rivals vs digital boardcard game extremely elegant uxui great sure art style isnt clearest supporting art backgrounds mechanics play work extremely well thing game available ios android kinda suggest check
bluffing rockpaperscissors based vs card game doesnt feel elegant random number generator plays role
skinnerbox grinder linear gear progression trick classes skills based items certain items options choose skills change time yet gameplay literal grinding expect actual arpg either feels like game time acting barrier everything
play like hitscan instant death gaming prefer arcade approach recommend fun game time played roughly seconds firefights seconds ambushed instantly killed
absolutely terrible fp shooter eg start tutorial unable invert mouse rebind keys english translations bad dont
turn based rpg ridiculous vo youll laugh drunken dude intro ridiculous translations english die first map easily playing perfectly maybe meant happen rather uninstall
error trial meant feeble people need git good
unique twist mana color like mtg previously generated mana change color attempt cast spell different color hero unique twist every creature doesnt attack blocking default hero attacked blocked creatures killed feels like poor mans hearthstone mtg like mana system game feels plain mundane boring edit game officially dead avg player amount steam chart would claim reasons come basic uxui issues eg hovering mouse cursor card doesnt show card delay annoying

great unique mechanics sadly arent players play game
absolutely unpolished infested broken english translated obviously chinese board mechanic neat enough check fable fortune adult hearthstone
worth time game also dead players check fable fortune adult hearthstone instead

uxui annoying hell avoid p resolutions wont work show slice screen clicking move hex ends turn automatically doesnt allow attack
thousands hours card games played game designer gaming journalist great dcg much depth hearthstone yet players feel familiar extra rules added top prefer elder scrolls legends feels way elegant crossplatform pc xbox main issue game nearly dead arent players stumbled via steam labs hope see second life deserves throws boosters face early game like candy
great unique mechanics game great issue simply players multiplayer game recommend game better friend play music pretty damn annoying guitar porn though
nice game essentially ascension twist lousy sfxs great gameplay concept main issue obviously players yet play vs aibots
simple gameplay surprisingly enjoyable due great aesthetics twitch action reaction game requires two buttons play
prefer dota underlords current auto chess variants idea league legends tactics quite yet due following reasons items guaranteed random number generator fested one item hero even loss gives random item selection global items effect everything change gameplay interesting ways ios client links steam played ios tier units generally much stronger original auto chess random number generator still plays quite huge role currently caster meta extremely strong mass aoe acquiring four scaled units maxed magic resistance doesnt quite work requires tier unit lose games matter fine wi real statsprofile statistics current version

terrible uxui k support gameplaywise people enjoy call duty
terrible uxui terrible voice acting
yakuza rd person action drama story wtfjapan beat em tons mini games random content makes really weird writing absolutely suberb like proper movie drama quality games havent really seen combat isnt particularly indepth even feel balanced constant evolving new encounters make game great absolutely unique game heavily recommended anyone whos real story however chapter decided uninstall game spot healing items impossible fight leaving reinas bar every single hit weapons attackers ish knocks stuns
first might think game less random number generator competitors thats simply true know play game outcomes become purely random number generator complete control matches prize drafts played play constructed winrate even winrate matches feel random number generator impact initial hero creep positions drawn hand eg signature cards deck dont get single one game arrowscurves golden ticket secret shop isnt mirrored consumables games without single tp creep spawns lanes many things control lead play doesnt matter played game perfectly

terrible first last experience zillion games simply interest play game didnt like ingame tips jumping screen spawn game first time combat didnt manage single action small ship someone ways fired rifle ship next us managed almost reload crouched beyond side ship died times instantly first seconds without idea killed deaths supposed wait seconds thanks
played pretty much every dcg definitely enjoyable experience real cyberpunk story top basic mechanics consist one sided damage meaning attacked target takes damage mana system aka credits follows logic eg hearthstone max per turn refresh maximum turn x main lanes one creature aka agent lane fighting opposing lane unopposed damage dealt player agent lane room buffs debuffs x support lane various timed buffsdebuffs eg creatures gain armor typical attack vs health added armor top flat dmg reduction source win condition least beginning game deal damage unopposed lanevia actionspell cards acquire operation points however couldnt proceed yakuza ambush since game kept repeatedly hanging yellow outline cards unable actions could pass turn

picked game free weekend get keep sad story really game looks feels absolutely fine simply arent players around actually want play game see reason since literally players theyve randomly generated procedual dungeons etc mean puzzle combat action focused attack autoattacks based cooldowns least guardian eg wow playing mmorpg alone isnt worth heard people left game early early access due latency bug issues didnt whole minutes roamed alone issue lack players id play simply party play
sounds great looks great plays well general issue playing quite pointless achieving anything doesnt really feel achieving anything since relative strength always excellent fp game dont see single reason pay
tutorialization ingame tips uterrly confused actions andor played
want adhd shooter movement plays minimal role
k rounds various mobas played way quick gameplay taste hectic mess battleborn overwatch dont consider mobas also enjoyable
boring didnt enjoy gameplay consist travel
extremely boring simple repetitive task based shooter repeats trick end without interesting lacks hook true disappointment
excellent years ago crafting hats
highly recommended although early access plenty placeholder stuff game like duelyst love shardbound think replace mechanic like duelyst would work wonders though considering maps room move around escape hide lousy starting hand doesnt instantly mean loss downsides think point related uiux means game suberb least idea turn camera hovering enemy doesnt show movement line sight need click see move see line sight button checking line sight hex would epic help new players like lot fellow composer producer id like point music great
great base mechanics theres much work suggest youd wait total coinflip play die first ticks without able one action occasionally happens
didnt like simple much better strategic space related multiplayer games eg fractured space
excellent yet short procedual roguelite plenty choices make
didnt like ultra casual rd person shooter component based customization sounds lot better full screen didnt work p either wasnt part didnt like gameplay sucked
gameplay wise better world warships menus terrible forced tutorial asked click paint job clicked premium one couldnt get past without spending premium currency instant uninstall
didnt like clunky many better multiplayer fpss
didnt like wasnt game
didnt like terrible tutorial terrible controls clunky fun
didnt like good like eg walking dead games decentish rather watch movie
although like idea didnt like implementation felt like chore repeat steps
didnt like nice ost voice acting
simply personal preference ui controls etc absolutely fine simply didnt find game fun far roguelikeslites go doesnt feel character progression loot skill perk based instead focuses heavily stealth aspect
like civilization v expansions ui tweaks little new works thats downside weve seen hopefully new expansions add completely new mechanics mix mix
avid cardboardturn based fan astral heroes simply many issues considered enjoyable multiple lanes damage one sided damage attacker deals snowballs ridiculously easy feels extremely rngish due forced single player repetitive task simply better dcgs eg duelyst
highly recommended grim dawn arpg developers titan quest arpg closest soulmate diablo could expect get customization core arpgs meaningful character customization grim dawn epicly well end nice amount dual class combinations choices matter wont able pick everything skill trees theres respecing available early game recently added devotion tree somewhat similar path exiles passive tree adds extra depth tons socketables also grant new skills itemization awesome game plays well allows respecing sounds looks nice enough ignore facepalm level van helsings purchase grim dawn already wont disappointed
probably one best local multiplayers gaming history awesome awesome stuff pvp campaign twist mix roguelite arpg players attempt slay boss twist one player hero controls monsters traps kill hero monsters youll turn human instead players attempt killing boss level trick gain experience points human player delves deeper dungeons players get upgrade unique monsters forced make choices level well game surprisingly much complexity considering controls movement attack special buttons add randomized geartrinketsspells trikle gorgeous pixel art animation top even sounds awesome highly recommended

looking ftl like game art style im sure find fun give thumbs fell completely flat think dont grok style game crying suns
mind magic essentially oxygen included magic instead space fight demon things explore dungeon mean best way since oxygen included least basebuilder type game ever really gotten unlike oxygen included often spreading keeping things separate mind magic much compression relatively limited space build magic school expanding laterally easy means mostly building upwards good highly recommended
love art design game fantastic interesting premise game well basic game play loop bit tedious difficult avoid going internet get spoiler knowledge figure one finished yet hours im still playing guess says needs said
think problem really game made mistake playing book hours first game feels thin visually unimpressive comparison yet fill niche brain bad luck really think folks might like greater simplicity cleaner interface

marvels midnight suns fun game really like deck building combats reviews portrayed kind xcom superheroes wrong like fights tight spaces superheroes sense recommend loop getting better cards mission pretty well done heroes play differently enough enough unique strategy makes interesting put together teams selection enemies could broader much worse say fights tight spaces go hours edit spoke soon variety enemies least one point game variety increases substantially however layered extra graphics stuff none adds much anything game really mean dialogue story stuff fun really like magik spidermans bits playing paper dolls superheroes momentary pleasant diversion much effort put game honestly would good better full darkest dungeon interface well done cell animation effects fight scenes ok bits really fun first times see like right get deadpool gives thumbs sign explosion happens behind hahah none extra graphics layer well done none good art direction seems worth effort expended say diehard marvel comics fan since like good see characters done game like almost dream come true time meh lot art direction choices recommend maybe full price paying lot bling aint blingy
want love age wonders many good bits love customisation factions tomes magic development tree graphics great etc etc ai bad bad stack ai players many discounts special costs truly joyless affair beyond first difficultly level im fighting ai empire army like stacks units afford pay upkeep keep developing defeat one full slightly bigger army ai awful tactically within two turns completely replenished army also defeat army showing wear two turns laterhere comes another army size keeps happening tactically ai dumb post play battles tactically use autobattle feature general dumb end playing multiple fairly dull tactical battles watching army takes long time replace eroded ais stupid countless forces ruins sense playing opponent vaguely similar clearly playing human weird stupid computers spam armies times faster im sure ways around im sure strategies could using account im equally sure would find strategies fun disappointment really looking forward game spent far getting wish waited months sale im hours much x game standards feel like done fun play dumb ai players updated id heard maybe fixed ai somewhat nope still exactly things spamming massive armies far greater rate human player minimal intelligence disappointing much well done game maybe missing something im willing convinced im playing wrong
would like kind person likes game really fun vibe although english accents convincing dont like point click adventure games anymore regardless dressed new interesting mechanics shame game really cool bits
games point click elements way fiddly enough information provided happen make certain choices intended comedic game could understand bits doesnt seem want funny enough justify seemingly random choice turning someone package meat example
see people might enjoy game thing though enough going different spaceshipjacking missions get invested
reasonably good deckbuilding game like buildacard element art fun doesnt pop way fights tight spaces slay spire find thinking id rather playing one games think game gotten style first might recommended didnt stand much tougher crowd
terraforming mars probably good implementation could cant play table really want play want
story thin waste much time game unskippable bits dialog basic game play surprisingly fun nothing like reactor blow face knowing damn fault getting tricky things fast think missing something makes feel pressure though least game mode feel pressure get really pure puzzle game meaningful force compelling work faster way game play doesnt match story line
sure pretty even fantastic looking art direction top notch writing especially dialogue good forced enjoy long cutscenes scenes walking around virtually nothing scenes conversations illusory player input etc actual game part computer game tedious superlinear thin nearly invisible sat hours play looking library realized couldnt bothered play tedious game order see happens next wish made exactly disney animated series like everything nearly exactly dont bother illusion playing game
mass effect one best computer games ever made except prettier whats like maybe price tag probably wait sale unless superfan like played long time
super linear really spectator gets shoot things really creepy art direction top notch various stations pretty incredible slice life bits wonder walk worth sale edit change negative review continues gorgeous looking game gets near end linearity becomes unbearable cant bothered finish maybe deep sale worth maybe tolerance linearity
bought full price came would unhappy short railroady pun somewhat intended deep sale part bundle two games ok definitely atmospheric gun play fine like terry pratchett reference
good game probably best game type played since way back original commandos necessarily innovative thats ok
excellent deck builder game sort like spy martial arts version slay spire think like better slay spire saying something since game consumed full week
played hoursand like dont care anything happening game try hit weird balance main character good guy also bandit outlaw murders people lost guess maybe really gta games maybe would appeal never got feels like thing old west
well constructed little adventurestory game makes good use board game tabletop rpg style mechanics good writing nice art music could makeover
nd favourite fallout fallout new vegas huge world interesting quests main plotline compelling good fantastic game
fantastic looking game sure first wasnt sure would like game play played got understanding punishing dark souls games played man pretty punishing im usually something overall structure game makes work one thing really like doesnt explain lore didactic way starts talking things rings tarnished whatever already know confidence either youll catch b dont really care want get murdering thats good thing fantasy games
think one game essentially unplayable current form due crashes happen game starts getting really interesting try month two point working properly change review actually finish entire game form opinion principle seems like fun edit ok time later seem fixed bugs making game unplayable think expected based distant worlds want updated version game actually works guess recommend playing though im sure actually like different cool bits buti dont know sure thing im going switch thumb actually works really thumb sideways
tentative rating hours update finished havent seen end yet certain assessment least point easily creatively weird game played years really say without potentially ruining anyone reading others said looks vaguely interesting stop learning either buy dont buy dont investigate every fact learn happens within reduce enjoyment edit completing game games need like completely unpredictable also incredible fun
valheim deep rock galactic better games occupies interesting space two im enjoying
certainly lot brutal decisions right answer lesser two evils options based little information possible outcomes im sure feel like maybe ok robot im glad want talk good robot speech option doesnt make easy actually roleplay anything noble pragmatic callous realist gameplay well executed probably best seen type game situations pretty interesting bit unsurprising give thumbs im glad didnt pay full price sale worth
better considered piece interactive fiction game perspective enjoyed think might enjoyed graphic novel bunch wonderfully absurd weird elements seemingly low quality graphics adds experience rather detracts final sequence little bit let sense really knowing truth cool
far cry game also bad ass tiger ever definitely gets vote
far cry game shoot lots people story involves psychopaths one likely take bases drive around stuff mention shoot lots people happen enjoy formula
good game cool bits problem playing wish playing oxygen included space havens fault games wants better
fun coop game
first ignore list friend talked fun another friend im like ok canadian aint bad ill try im like fond weird art style waitwas troll im hours game brilliant first survival sim type game really able get enjoy gorgeous pixelated way weird things come astonish full spoilers try read internet like except basic hints complaint valheim dedicated server seems bit finicky early access im betting ironed
game plain weird way could get many cut scenes well enough actually playing game butim still giving thumbs im glad game exists world doesnt give crap whether like trying really new things tried
really really want love total war three kingdoms romance three kingdoms cool story environment interface seems incorporate good improvements neat crusader kingsish family building political elements pieces man experienced total war warhammer realize cant total war normal dudes fighting lizardfolk vs dark elves dwarves vs vampires really hard go back regular old human beings fighting semirealistic battles tw three kingdoms im giving thumbs really think good game dont play tw warhammer first
game looks fantastic story seems vaguely interesting swinging around light saber fun platformfight sequence like times wasting minutes life go back meditation circle time screwed reminded much hate deep abiding hate consolestyle saves hates simply cant bothered play drained fun enjoy things maybe game
problems sure buggy quests sometimes dont work properly oh lord lot sexist imagery etc etc etc also like cd projekt red stuck fingers imagination future would look like circa created whole game forgive pretty much sins creating retrofuture metropolis dreams fun play
trading elements seem least interesting game quite fun pretty deep lots interacting systems enough roleplaying elements spice
spooky weird maybe quite scary might hoped later parts gained lot powers thats necessarily bad thing fun game builds world quickly minimal effort visuals good art direction
great wargame simple enough dive right complex enough reward learning going
dont bother single player game man riot friends tremendous fun tense exciting feel like learning play edit play even better thought first game finely balanced tense exciting also fun funny beers hilarious edit returning game time away take back said single player passable even fun doesnt come close fun multiplayer ok
im sure ever finish game somuch layers certain brilliant could greatest point click adventure game ever made
great lighter space game enjoy pixel graphics enough depth hard decisions make worth time playing
single player campaign would worth original purchase price game looks great love back forth fighty robot running around walls campaign linear heck far short im glad paid cdn multiplayer afterthought playing afternoon im hooked mixture frames per second human running around frames per second fightyrobot mayhem really lot fun like multiplayer expect team work side unless part organized group still blast anyway im still sure worth full price sale well worth
im still sure like ck think better designed game ck made lot good choices especially around helping newer players figure things streamlining polishing things weird hypercomplex charm ck lost
see others would enjoy combination pixel art steep learning curve makes inaccessible
wanted isnt gamess fault wanted something like alpha centauri got thin characterless skin civ
really wanted like game really really big sentinels multiverse fan card game characters worldbuilding done game virtues different modes characters go neat build interesting choices lot interface well designed attractive game flaws cant overlook bad choice kind playermade character center game really bad choice player made character detracts enjoyment greatly love adam rebatarros art cards fails translated animation maybe execution anyway find game unattractive virtues cant outweigh flaws
im going recommend would totally play board game game computer game admit hold interest long
linear really along ride story line interesting visuals well done worth anyway
bridge far series first two everything bit tedious dull released first game series instead last probably would ok cant hold comparison
good stuff arkham asylum better executed
solidly designed fun game mix stealth fighty elements balanced well get say im batman lot thugs get repetitive main villain characters welldesigned art direction excellent
played hours app ipad playing pc better dont away
since first released every draws back maybe cool time every single time disappointed back seemed like wasnt much worlds sort samey nd time tried made farther seemed tedious pointless release recent update derelict ships thought maybe enjoy started almost immediately experienced gamebreaking camera glitch accept walk away think edited ok last bit take back revise review recommended still far many bugs game something ongoing four years changes made made mostly fun play like new questbased systems everything looks better place seems lived space stations generally better crossing line thumbs territory
game playwise pretty much assassins creed jump things climb things murder people etc winning awards new innovative elements huge although vastly squashed compared actual greece obviously gorgeous often felt like hanging beach characters especially kassandra fun quests often funny dramatic interesting love mercenaries hunt periodically shades system shadows mordor solid fun enjoyable game
take review heavy grain salt could make mins tutorial mission give like things dislike darkest dungeon xcom sort wrapped one literally falling asleep mean bad game idea know tastes attention span let get apparently fine line game like enjoy game find dull uninteresting
really hard figure would gladly put hundreds upon hundreds hours multiple paradox games yet stare blankly imperator rome minutes give walk away people dont get crusader kings feel maybe come explanation guess two reasons ancient rome leaves cold setting im interested mechanics interface seem detailed cryptic laughable heard exact criticism paradox games took immediately felt natural eg ck hoi say cant recommend game thats best explanation come honestly satsifying
game could see people might enjoy got clever mechanics good looking interface well designed reached points one game realized basic issue dont like casual puzzle games like meat ultimately seems like thing island long move shortly filled island indicator feels like could keep playing endlessly suppose probably selling point target audience isnt
pretty much exactly would expected another borderlands game guns seem less colorful varied interesting art design seems muddier used new planetary environments add lot liked first two games hard see wouldnt like one
really wanted like game see others would really like simply patience th time hyperjumped planets stop much justwatching space go elite dangerous edited another hours im switching thumbs following reasons fun game play friend think added bunch qol improvements since last played make bit less tedious bigger storyline eg thargoid invasion genuinely exciting interesting really look fantastic
keep coming back one probably game type really enjoyed cant explain
im playing along enjoying alright much get things make stuff take game like feel like grinding thenstuff happens interesting stuff mind blowing unexpected stuff stuff helps game transcend standard survival game genre excellence
pretty addictive game fun would hope say magic gathering game downsides played hours straight sign stopping climb bloody spire
im going recommend think gorgeous creepy think designers trying something truly new interesting think lot people would enjoy tremendously said hours im going farther feel would better either less game game amount game exactly wrong amount also style hack slash involved something find bit tedious said game brilliant innovations beyond general impeccable art sound way game works player lack headsupdisplay overt tutorial rules example delivered diagetic ways also hallucinatory effects senua experiences incredible recommended
good total war warhammer lizards
fairly solid tactical skirmish game fighting interesting enough story line entirely linear far tell recommend didnt finish ok good enough compete stuff steam library moment worth sale like sort game lot
interesting puzzle game edit played lot upgrade fascinating puzzle game ever played real brainburner best possible way
fun tactical game much like combination darkest dungeon legend grimdark different character types interesting play complaint steep learning moment campaign game steep think game fundamentally broken moment played hours clearly enjoyed im going give another try eventually get past point think makes ironman mode impossible least
really wanted like game hours cant see playing things really well art direction great voice acting tactical gameplay leaves cold seems none depth hoping also third person wandering around feels like wasted time feel like game would better focused tactical side cut exploration bits focused exploration bits made rpg isjust thing
art direction excellent game play solid fun least first playthrough normal difficulty least danger ramps nicely move game meaning im always sweating im sure much replayability sure yet overall enjoyable game watch oxygen level update recommend game seems short cost hope expansions future others might get replayability though
adds number interesting things base game really love three new troop classes new enemies great well covert actions fun addition still play anything rookie difficulty though seems tough enough
im biggest fan sim builder games one gripped get go strips lot unnecessary stuff sort game adds physics layers twodimensionalness belies complexity cant wait new biomes full release
many cut scenes much running around really anything mention cutscenes limited attention span cant take needed something action packed wasnt maybe people groove stealth elements enjoyed first game im exactly sure one falls flat good looking game though terms environments costumes
supergiant games products visually treat love weird fantasy vibe game play interesting thought first like fantasy basketball rites starting see excitement
another rpg taught dont enjoy types rpgs anymore really good twist story line means playing agents tyrannical overlord well executed makes decisions need made far interesting style game dont attention span anymore cant see ever finishing problem game
fact played hours uninstalled problem game problem attention span used love computer rpgs like one best genre dont love age taking toll fashion anyway great game like style hard see liking
hope put adventures art blurb appeal hard imagine wont enjoy
think lot folks would enjoy game number good things countryside nonhuman art gorgeous fighting system intriguing difficult master enjoy challenge realistic premise breath fresh air fantasy elements main character engaging enjoyed emotional roller coaster poor chap going hours playim countryside great characters conversations cutscenes many long seem like pacing islets call slow things always seems take least minutes longer fun quests funny thrilling end tedious example early bit competing another character see many hares hunt period time took seriously spent maybe hour half real time wandering forest hunting hares quite peaceful even relaxing enjoyed suppose like bad also kept waiting something else happen like really supposed hunting hares setting something exciting nopejust hunting hares people might enjoy lot left bit annoyed really wanted like might longer attention span get joy wandering around beautiful medieval bohemia could game also commend developers trying truly historical game like hope get sort thing telling would rather play witcher played steam probably closest analogue game third time continue playing game
mechanically game interesting fusion kind baldurs gateesque rpg warcraftesque rts game think successful fusing two genres thus thumb said hope game would transcend two genres neither favorite type game isnt case lorenarrative nothing havent seen gameplay two sides particularly innovative really like genres worth buying sale may enjoy much im unhappy bought
solitaire really normally hate enough interesting stuff going especially around choosing right equipment make enjoyable fourteen hours play sale price worth
cheeseburger boomer peaches hurk kim nick beautiful mountain scenery driving around cool cars etc lots shooting cool things barely barely compensate one stupidest endings game ever makes far cry ending seem logical im giving thumbs seriously good game could created pushed towards ending led inexorably ending ending would wow yeah ok get brilliant far cry aint man cheeseburger awesome
think game people looking exactly game want painstaking meticulous crushing every mistake rewards patience thoughtfulness attention detail care absolutely none things im going give thumbs fact isnt right doesnt mean wont right
really would prefer movie actually playing seems developers would well
wanted love game couldnt apparently need eye candy dont know new xcom games felt exciting tense felt tedious
wants steampunk legend grimrock didnt keep interest edit developer responded saying want details specifically asking talk properties game didnt like fair enough environments much sameness found monsters bit dull whole armor thing could interesting felt forced felt like played virtually game eg log twice fairly recent memory need play found several areas frustrating beyond attention span try figure defeat enemies repeated load die load die cycles obviously reactions objective aesthetic judgements might play game enjoy tremendously
enjoyed far expected atmospheric
gameplay repetitive man love orcs tolkien purist screaming rage half time stifled
good card game much else said
everything could wanted battletech game except jump ship cutscenes wear welcome quickly
think probably surpasses hoi simplifies right places keeping complexity needed think much strongly alternate history generator hoi
simply play game excellent literally unhealthy game activates one turn urge strongly game played like hours melt away im left wondering heck happened business meeting oh man incredible idiot think recommend others better self control like simstyle games hard imagine one wont least fun bad nicotine games
kickstarted game want love game really art direction excellent kinds cool ideas developers really done well given budget went game aiming high execution well dull im hours im sure revelations core mystery game im longer interested game scripted small kind sandbox eg fallout scripted enough traditional fp rpglike game eg new wolfenstein games bioshock occupies uncomfortable middle ground cutscenes especially memory cut scenes intended poignant andor disturbing mostly annoying crafting system feels like unecessary distraction survival elements feel tacked opposed integrated think developers would better focus excellent visuals intriguing core story drop gamey extras make shorter scripted game maybe dont attention span thats probably true
clever concept thing
thing see others might enjoy felt sort pointless
pretty dull
best game series ever
solid x fantasy game like combat system lot
nice addition probably expensive still good
lot fun even ludicrous
enjoyable lots feels short price get vast budget set make work antifa propaganda acid timing game couldnt better edit nd playthroughid say worth original price writing overthetop best possible ways kind fever hallucination america bunch scandanavians could produce mean compliment
probably best science fiction rpg far system shock comes close think
one best games type surmounted sequel
difficult lots fun still havent able finish someday
almost good medieval total war came high praise since med tw one favorite strategy games time love unit mixes wonderful graphics heroes seem powerful
years old still excellent tied wow city heroes favorite mmos
best ww war game ever played love making divisions custom brigades love taking russia italy
quite intriguing crusader kings deep immersive trade system particularly interesting
groundbreaking endless space felt solid x space game
excellent x game interesting weird fantasy setting
game surprise far fun expected
interesting game havent made end yet sure ever really appreciate
excellent x space game enough uniqueness make stand crowd really needs variety victory conditions though end game drag obvious win actually defeating enemies takes much time
goofy get probably offensive many recommend yet really good tactical game lot cool story ideas
im feeling depressed moment died sign good game
graphically game much write home codingwise buggy prone crashes lags like crazy loading even given gameplaywise excellent thinking options yields benefits strategic tactical level random monsters provide lot spice keeps things interesting challenging higher difficulty levels ai tough dont let somewhat goofy graphics fool enjoy turnbased x strategy games probably enjoy one
indepth game well worth time takes get know
one hardest decisions ever make computer game deciding door stanley parable
get disconnected time internet fine every single game servers host selection whatever worst thing get disconnected gain exp anything waste itme
fun little game lot love detail every villain plays different fun bring build max power level
awesome casual game although qol qould nice clicking x map start animations easy move maps upgrading digging interface seeing dream fragments left map
potential lacks content lot content
reminds old warcraft custom games really want like seriously missing qol balancing point sitting front screen waiting luck give better units opponent devs easily improve game add x x x game speed option games take long time seriously sucks count minutes add tooltips stats desciptions units ingame best also add compendium hover feature allow meaningful choice strategy let choose star upgradedirection let choose unit almost way influence game except using spell everything else random cant choose siege unit better break towers balance higher tier unit received sides played first map four times received elf archers whereas cpu already advanced unites meaningful spells leeway upgrading gameplay match
fuck hats whoever programmed insane execution
would great tactical game gave hints enemy intents leave guessing would also great didnt click every single ability instead would able use hotkeys would great could lock standard army without select every time move map base idea cool execution lacking devs desperately need someone knows something qol usability
game story game card mechanics bland fights grindy controls focused console gamers really regret purchase
lot going game hundread cards skills passives go notice empty feels cards classes feel initial excitment feels hollow narrow single word would say game feels cluttered many cards almost cards take strategy next level top also fact cards level experience repetitive task playing often possible point starts feel like work lastly want comment weird things going example hero get vulnerable fire master water magic shouldnt opposite
knew summoning creatures could fun game lots flaws hotkeys cast cards running around map weird wyrd mechanics core mechanic fighting cards cool
feels unfinished compared binding isaac pee poop feel lame immersive grossness isnt core game mechanics ok match low qol example spells interact common tile nowhere says tile common count
simple addicting little game forage dig craft way victory thing didnt like way automate everything autoplants farm digging sand still lots fun reach point
game beautiful wish spent money actual gameplay autoaim ignores nearby creatures thus misses dodge wonky rpgelements mostly temporary wish get permanent multishot note singleplayer review guess coop game fun
one game amazing picked boy didnt let game ticks boxes challenging diverse content many acts bosses maps great puzzles secrets explore lots diverse classes want play
absolutely amazing play linux means game randomly crashes still preserved hours game many things right loot classes unlocks enemies fun every single playthrough bonus apparently create weapon mods
slay spire meets hearthstone definitely great combination fun high replayability still game missing hotkeys expect amazingly low price
game hard really hard always solution tip use drawing feature mark solutions boils marking onlytilepossiblities
thought path exile clone boy game fun might first time game motivated bring multiple characters level qolfeatures kinda makes sob every time look poe really gem definitely worth
idea execution great intellectually challenging completing levels workshop curious kind voxel image hidden fun challenging gallery brought resemblance challenge compare something like hexcells tametsi sweat every move
appears hexcellssudoku clone issues tutorial doesnt really explain game need think like sudoku rmb helper overlay helpful rmb tile placed remove instead highlighting paths tile blocks annoying please let draw
skeptical game basically neat twist needs collect personal data skeptical
big fan complex card games dont problems bad uis either one doesnt dont seem hotkeys everything convoluted mess devs really focus decluttering ui user experience thing know stuffing everything single screen answer
disappointing combat mechanics solid appear hotkeys everything done click mouse feels much like mobile game
like logic love hexcells
game hidden gem carefully craft winitall strategy combining numerous items associated sets attacks based atmosphere deck building mechanics like slay spire roguebook whereas similar bloodcard obiously game flaw real keyboard controls things lack explanation example unaware prevents dodge happens char hidden also cool part try see happens guess makes game much fun
relaxing similiar hexcells tametsi unfortunately short wish levels
idea fun implementation way skip cut scenes furthermore fast forwarding available listened record first time also game helping hong kong chinese police state art surveillance tools find distateful seeing current riots hk
like storyrich games definitely treat unfortunately dont got really cool interesting sportsarena game gets polluted lots pointless dialogues add insult injury game crash nailbiting fight buy really clicking hundreds pointless dialogues watching animations cart travelling b c otherwise stay away
st colony starvation nd colony couldnt breath rd colony heat death th colony slimelung disease th colony still hanging game seriously hard also fun thing missing real tutorial trial error lot time gets going
good fun challenging unique game mechanics bad hotkeys
game addicting still cant recommend art setting story fun immersive core mechanics everything repetetive chore run around craft run around content hardlocked behind quests gated speaking specific non player character specific weekday fast way fastforward time meditating sleeping fast cant even minimize game background autopauses focus loss furthermore ingame recipes run somewhere remember need craft run back base craft run build end h run finished got derailed donkey wont come anymore bring corpses need corpses get skulls quest
game spending ct sate gambling needs healthy investment save millions
amazing game since last got drawn deep game makes game good opinion dimensions everything feels perfect sized build giant ft submarine looks lika giant ft submarine feels like giant ft submarine afraid actually starting struggle navigate love whole game immersive experience
gameplay cool really pisses game bought spams like game please rate us menu every hour therefor cant recommend game continue playing get moneys worth still feels
use redshell mine data respond deleting game stay away
best create kingdom simulator even better mods
card game check monarchy check sisi check local german developers check recommendation check like great small sessions provides lot tactical depth first thought ccg like hearthstone faeria see cards available start game use buy bought cards get added deck used buy even cards youve played war omens know works things perfect tutorial really confusing game vs ai everything became clear storymode yet ea devs active game lacks bit diversity especially last turns cards bought maybe force game end next turns cards bought let player reuse discarded cards infinite combos anyways think worth recommend
bought game financed devs remove features bought make free feel scammed
finally many years searching finally found definite spiritual successor popular wc fun map mad balls arena ah good old days battlenet
definite successor diablo almost everything set items missing
awesome game lots replayability definitly worth got wizard craft magic items sockets fill spell blocks beginning item slots example make one spell firemulti shotshoming shots later get expand slots firemultihomingsplitgo wallsricochet spell instantly clears mobs different spell blocks combine expect screen filled mad spells fun
maybe worth full overall solid arpg experience fun playing thats matters
much content far content warrants high prize im really convinced released game worth payed one best adventures ever played
played hours went bed got next morning heard sound rain thinking good dont need water plants today
early access done right shape game first eagame played devs really involved community actively listen balancing feedback main designer really likes explain something indepth example usually hangs around discord chat talking cards game mtg meets chess card game plays board beginning board empty turn place lands summon creatures lands move creatures harvest faeria single ressource fight repeat also theres lot events really mean theres structures cant move good big plays card games dont compare move enemy defender away opponents orb thing need destroy event move deal last damage check turn creature cute frog jump jump enemy creature play land territory play haste creature kill check play lots creatures front orb hold enemy check game turnarounds moments make go wow stare screen love hate best part free play ea game become free dont try
skyrim decent game made great mods bethesda publisher starts people pay mods vanilla game without mods nothing would recommend people play
interesting game uses ressources like crazy also prevents using keyboard run background
got game steam sumer sale friend gifted first pretty disappointed gift revies bad thought waste money day game recieved update beta thought give try far im impressed game fun mix minecraft terraria rust dayz whole lots things descover atmosphere amazing especially night get started get around wood iron ore oil iron reddish puddingshaped hill oil black one find sulphur yellow stuff see afar maybe sand looks like sand used lamps build first house wooden blocks iron oil sulphur make first weapon night stay near home giant brown worms try kill animals glow green prey kill make food healing pack basic armor monsters sometimes drop ore blueprints advance game kill explore new ressources fun
game started great felt repetetive pretty fast mix orcs must die ogame
binding isaac borderlands child name would nuclear throne featuring thousand ways die game rougelike core choose one several alien creatures pick trusty gun start kick ass weapons range basic revolver grenade launchers poison crossbows plasma rifles waiting game worth price got keys rsteamgameswap

highly recommend game enjoy card games really enjoing much quite lot depth game gives huge replay value also lots progression reason keep coming back pay win people may complain sure element card game really reason would put money game access content like start get flagships either faction think like character class classes fairly balanced want try different play styles recommend buy coin purchased points access classes ball want play defensive want aggressive want middle ground want win game really shines also top blast play star trek universe always fantasy spaceship battles like theyve come brilliant way make feel strategic really love game encourage give go quite fun last thing really enjoy although card game bc way animations work feels much less like card game id say closest feel lis something like slay spire
fun addictive would recommend everyone play game
bit simplistic side things often simple plainly better
play mics friends great time swear eachother laugh eachother kill lot zombies great replaylability need make ui friendly aver great coop game
addictive fun comes pay progress faster system dont spend money game reach progress ceiling easy fast need access masters stand fighting chance yes need pay hefty youll need rubies shards cards etc build strengthen arsenal yes youll need pay heft well choose pay progress hindered unlock cards much difficult slower master options limited make lose lot aof games remain stuck rank much longer others probably paid asked options available gets thumbs gameconcept mechanics major thumbs greedy money grabbing system
awesome sequel legendary left dead awesome graphics adequate story bugs releaseexcellent fun playing friends expect updates content least next couple years highly recommended
uncomplicated fun nice concept nice backstory kinda educational worth especially sale
solid fun relaxing boring worth nice artwork cool dialogues choices make matter music fitting cant think anything else ask early release hope devs keep working title excellent potential develop series got sale get
could easily smartphone game lacks real depth full repetitive tedious tasks totally unbalanced makes lose interest turns think developers spam spawning type games cuz look closely games designed excactly philosophy strategy gamenone games actually strategy games nothing ponder plan execute even actual opponents click click game order things thing good test durability left mouse button stir away one unless want something play totally bored life
game like old love old loves like bomb planted heart always come rushing go heaven puns intended
ohh game huge success genre although early access doesnt seem something important vital missing ok tweaks maybe needed feels plays like properly complete release game mechanic equipment bound cards interesting would like option play classic way well cards equipment separate aspects game understand critique act really long didnt mind honest hrs act close finish bored said would like see things added tweaked game devs would like multiplayer coop modeoption mean really would love play game friends forming dd like pose go missions would really fun unique dont know games apart classic rpgs wot think devs feasible would like able party heros system like used xcom start end characters squad mentioned would like classic approach mode equipment equipment cards cards individual mechanics strategy layer would like see simpler way enemies going attack like simply hovering picture instead trying pick tiny attack symbol bottom figure amongst tiny infos would like modifier description different terrains affect attacks defences hope devs keep developing supporting game really took brilliant idea made moree good game hands right
game could fun potential fun game really fails miserably every character play slower difficult handle corners ai ai gets character previously lot faster handles corners almost perfectly thus race mechanics really fail every time money system give gringe feeling takes long get decent ammount money even simplest upgrade didnt made far get useful upgrade also someone explain upgrade lets unlock scenes storyboard frickin use last importantly finish championship matter finish st last game gets back main menu thing exit game buy things enter another championship enter game mode conclusion game badly executed broken dont get even find free giveaway

seemed first pretty uninspired doom clone different skin actually pretty decent writing unique gameplay gimmick fashion police squad fashion crimes unique require specific response gameplaywise means need use different weapons enemy type game keeps pretty fun although switch weapons time bit tiring well challenge
tumbleweed express fairly unpolished game innovative good design importantly fun feels like devs made game fun passion shows gameplay engaging particularly balanced minor bugs
spacejump distinct visual style thats excels shoot enemies occasionally theyll drop green glowing powerups shoot one two allies aid attack thats niceties damage cooldown sort thing would exciting game jam submission alpha build disappointing finished game
faithful modernization classic strategy gameplay aerial combat bad game suffers nongamebreaking bugs turnbased combat thats core gameplay extremely solid unlike xcom successors
decent basic premise plot suffers weird irregularities replays quizgiving family members act completely differently private conversations differ oddly phased dialogue different people tell thing round poor skip control tab skip often flags repetitive dialog new way skip specific point game worth play dont hurt wallet
guess important thing note classic multiplayer game often played two teams one sub one destroyer extremely underwhelming implemented could amazing experience multiplayer support dumb singleplayer

amazing game impressive unique gameplay reminds old days commodore couldnt stop playing game reached areas done yet cant wait new content comes minor bugs wishing place store special items lock items dont accidently sell
game totally sucks game linear cant interact anything developer assigned given back history story understanding controls voice scenes abrupt thus make sense weird things like pick flowers reason field also long pauses trying tell story weird scenes see body minutes dragged weird mental head trip quit
paid collectors edition game total crap people block doorways die constantly story totally lame unless expert frames per second need group players get missions game sucks many levels
awesome game storytelling wish branching possiblities
horrible remake civ many problems game list horrible confusing ui confusing tech tree difficult figure research get want meaningless tech names terrible ai sit bombing city opponent sends nothing repetitive conversations ai players turn sounds difficult manage troops map due overlapping graphics troops blocked troops millions pointless aliens never meet another alien race visit planets fight humans might well play previous civ least get historical achievements game feels like made lazy uncreative people lets make space civ creating new graphics overlaying top last civ game rip stuff dont need make quick money
still basic interface bugs abandoned devs
game seems fun challenges alone though devs earn welldeserved negative review
excellent little puzzle game maybe little like minesweeper look forward playing others series
endless timewasting manual saves enemies appearing thin air cleared areas clunky interface repetitive fights many times need beat group enemies dont waste time
people think bethesda rpgs arent janky enough
skirmish ai ruins game expect face titan every mission second space wolf campaign shield activates time literally x shots blocked row dreadnaught
update issue appears fixed seems bug rather save corruption issue although idea bugfix applied game wholeheartedly recommend game original great game sadly recent update caused savegame corruption randomly occur unless complete game one sitting product useless developers could cant fix underlying problem least keep series autosaves game fall back previous save reload fails better lose round turns progress hours play
good physics puzzleplatformer comes within whisker outstaying welcome lack autorolling ball halfway last level
lowquality platforming lots people seem compare dark souls presumably people still stuck undead asylum playing feels like developers grudgingly permitted intrude art project
game bugged make steam think always running fixed restarting steam quickly uninstalling game
update october new developer taken game looks keen resolve issues found last played particular making singleplayer mode fully offline works would probably change recommendation actual gameplay good original review buggy poor ui nonsensical online requirement happily torpedoes progress slightest blip internet connection
glitchy mess finally abandon corrupted save file third game series still numerous bugs unfixed first game developers least choose accurate name studio
really good game continually annoys player popups games androidiphone another game enjoying game leave us review well heres review
glitchy obscure controls either keyboardandmouse gamepad quite achievement reason see play understand assassins creed parkourtype games use thirdperson view see whats going control movement maybe game revolution time release one relic best left past
fine combat style batman arkham games less precise controls targeting specific enemies special abilities exercise frustration whilst open world gameplay missions closer assassins creed series enjoyable enough length main game hrs playthrough im keen delve downloadable content aware difficulty peaks early game gets steadily easier develop abilities attributes since new enemies introduced past certain point ultimately id recommend batman arkham series combat assassins creed series stronger story youve played mad max want something similar really like middleearth find shadow mordor reasonably fun something better comes along
nice idea hampered obtuse interface poorly explained systems equip defensive field projector weapon teammember hope remember middleclick hold apply someone suits provide power never clear much total whats using recharges happen runs even moving team around exercise frustration since carefully prepared formation eg guns front tech guy back happily ignored next time groupmove wouldve benefited feedback player clearer interface didnt sacrifice usability theme generally time oven
nice look graphics little busy areas caused motion sickness alleviated using ingame settings interesting story since game puzzlesolving behest disembodied voice portal series obvious comparison sadly talos principle favours puzzles numerous often repetitive became slog long various endings became available levels also helped enormous expect spend lot time running around even know solve puzzle area could benefited halfasmany levels puzzle development story thing persuaded repetitive task perhaps consider review lukewarm rather negative particularly plan play levels shorter bursts long period time
really expected like game based art style turnbased tactics enjoyed steamworld dig sadly game overly focused grinding levels due bizarre loss mechanic completing missions normally gives water cash experience bots participated bot killed perhaps junked would accurate mission gain experience lose abort mission lose half total water leads annoying situations bot gets killed must press mission avoid water hit still replay mission get experience bot died plus full star rating level want save time abort replay immediately well say goodbye half water wanting save repetitive task couldve avoided simple option restart mission time losing loot experience picked level turn rewind option even random ricochets cause unintended bot losses far frustrating play loss mechanic otherwise good game dont mind wasting time grinding consider review positive otherwise id suggest looking alternatives like invisible inc xcom shadowrun
excellent digital boardgame makes good use dice bring tension decision whilst giving lots room make use crew resources ship facilities influence odds contrary many reviewers saying random element fairly low far less example ftl easy minimise careful play poor decisions bad rolls limit later options however suspect many people rushing act turn doom later like good boardgame best played rush turns expect hour game youre considering choices carefully time writing devs appear actively engaged expansion game introducing new missions scenarios mix main game new characters unlocked ingame achievements expanding replayability
nice graphics sound animation lot interactive animation game puzzles present really challenge effort emotional journey fails resonate fear theres much hold remainder together glad finish game move something else

think allegory game works really reminded bit absurdist film exterminating angel horror game fails youre told various characters dont really get meet become involved nothing feels real detracts suspense instead almost comedy one jokes think must gotten game free point free somewhere steam completely id say certainly worth playing seeing think say allegory intriguing works probably wont playing unlock various endings
think pretty good mostly termed walking simulator hidden object light puzzle elements thats like story bit ambiguous really selling point one neat visuals thing dont care miss collectibles without warning makes attaining good ending impossible might willing replay game try get would want rather right away think id likely miss collectibles yeah id recommend like games like layers fear play mostly art
weak recommendation whats good game cosmetic stuff story voice acting card art unfortunately game play dated repetitive cards troops side lines tries take never makes feel like choices arent predetermined makes want come back fight different deck build see things go differently
guess dont understand gameplay seem walk back forth drop coins whenever lets dont seem able make choices lighting effects pretty
theme game postapocalyptic sorcerers vs cthulhu absolutely nothing wouldnt looked twice except sell two different flavors base game legacy version board game store work thought maybe buy long enough demo knew worked surprise surprise enjoyed quite bit decided instead buy downloadable content like legendary broadly similar negative side theres bit less adventure game feeling length session legendary feeling exploration puzzle solving bosses however theres lot neat things make like purchase new cards piles always available like dominion fact choose order stack deck neat pulling combos presumably mostly used function destroy cards dont like sitting top discard im interested exploring later different heroes also feel different one another despite fact building decks cards designers really used available make mage unique creatively possible suppose main negative lack mulitplayer dont love playing different characters forum says planning multiplayer couple years since last expansion think game probably complete still theres lot already wish popular game sentinels multiverse didnt care
well finished think thats good enough im getting tired wandering areas listening beeps like last chests found associated puzzles theyve way crannies first supraland like candy couldnt stop eating finished one moments liked bank prison area particularly combatwhile good yetis much better first game quite bit oldsame old also im convinced overall structure game game complete story around theres still upgrades chests find second half game like little dudes humorous observations game really lost something also think since second half game almost entirely backtracking things change places revist particularly area bad guys dungeon youve defeated still prisoners say things yeah recommend think youll enjoy suppose think youll get tired
love game sokoban variants make really think puzzle different way fall colors nice
loads fun similar games advisors petitioners come make yesno decisions includes greater strategic depth keep levels different resources balanced also includes city building part rounds similar darkest dungeon ill probably expand review finish seems like theres going lot fun story interesting navigate rivalries advisors
decided buy really liked main game thought since free maybe would give developer tip also support developer downloadable content sounded interesting im really upset paid since point tip developer however buying reason next content says short story well shorter short story even five minutes developer intends make paid downloadable content think also releasing bad idea people bought might inclined take chance downloadable content think going equally slim
well humm house story takes place looks nice otherwise lot frustrations narrator slow story doesnt enough explanation understandable read henry stanleys book gestures moving things difficult accomplish least taking long swipes mouse unintuitive directions even simple things like opening doors turn screws worse half time barely start turning proper direction get edge mouse pad recentering mouse start pulling direction screw starts turning backward really could pull hair otherwise suppose comes puzzles mostly finding things youve found theres generally much put action really worth frustration
well didnt play much requesting refund maybe dont really know im supposed found experience unpleasant start fmv movie thats fairly interesting things go leads believe youre going play something like gabriel knight tex murphy game maybe phantasmagoria youre dropped dark ugly mansion voice wasnt introduced insults whenever try inspect anything managed find two puzzles one okay puzzle switch positions knights modified chess board dumb puzzle things keys cash register way know keys press hint button provides instructions something figure without instructions fiddling since arbitrary get feedback youve successfully completed press hint button nothing really tells many times press hint button get instructions actual hints thats poor design opinion dont know prefer story driven mystery adventure games ill play puzzle collections think wont play annoying narrator constantly insulting clicking anything
wow free games good dont know anybody ever sells love new ideas sokoban blocks overworld connections interesting
little plot bit engaging last one even shorter even easier would promise game series substantial want purchase
didnt like puzzle open briefcase also think thought answer morse code puzzle better actual puzzle otherwise pretty fun suppose wish done time travel idea like making changes past would change things future kind thing generally speaking personality puzzles wasnt stuff see free play phone adventure games pretty cheap id still get sale want abide hr rule use buying games
game fun wonder got suppose bundle sort puzzle game puzzles involve randomization isnt really perfect way play like optimal way play draw cards turn lets move like chess piece play trying kill opposing pieces board quickly possible make cash lets upgrade cards ideally let take turns variety different army types play first leaves behind blight hurts end turn space second lets special abilities take second turn see rest
like great art card synergize fun ways gets repetitive pretty quickly like roguelike card games though
think game fabulous could hardly stop playing bought gone hours part makes addictive cant help turn around find something else say unlike witness none puzzle types seen far something completely unique required much box thinking instead id describe game sort like puzzle parts things like arkham asylum zelda without repetitive combat also strong story pull find bit lore godlike beings talking idea gameplay would recommend game people like exploring puzzle solving aspects action adventure games action limited occasional races flight challenges people like explore every bit area types games check every single achievement puzzles main world pretty easy point eventually get bored search hard puzzles completing mysteries like scavenger hunt riddles best hardest puzzles open pyramid real doozies
thanks much game didnt really know artist particular impressed still lifes dont normally find interesting beach scene reminded particularly wheres waldo also surprising seemed filled little jokes think hidden object idea interesting way explore paintings usually take painting made look thing painting think separately im sure thats best way appreciating art see things might seen otherwise
loved game thanks much making mazes fun gimmick none overly hard youve figured gimmick wrapped really pleasing art style like game sure play flebs game set similarly artistically pleasing minesweeperesque puzzles
think great challenging never allow guess color blind person little hard green introduced still possible bit careful
came game really loved writing talos principle one writers talos principle butits maybe see new screen game dont think hey look things explore instead think oh gosh click wonder id like game delivered tooltips small change wouldnt think would make break game think descriptions appear mouse would really make experience organic also game proud dozens characters dont know really qualify characters static dont anything like townsfolk traditional rpgs whose dialogue hidden within nested dialogue trees doesnt make anything say feel real dynamic way actual dialogue books dont know games maybe worried letting feel like protagonist afraid put words mouth speaker personality monologues become dialogues

game common solo roleplaying game books modern computer game want play something like lone wolf outer space cant really better space rangers games havent played much unlike negative reviews im comparing games think one good trying changes would make would port turn based space combat game space combat text bit disappointing also kind odd premise although youre importance real world game takes place virtual reality environment makes care less choices make beyond affect people quests arent real another issue game hard read text stretched across entire computer screen would lot playable could adjust width text window liking even better still would ported android

usually wait finish games completely rewrite review finish one wanted leave review game sale love played far finished chapter first thing say much beautiful previous games series always liked lighting effects actual drawings main characters much better done also although im sure game going put lot end idea maybe positive story three trust cat lot old woman cat lady instance feel like maybe something help protagonist never could suppose negative far puzzles perfunctory well see continues well see things go far gorgeous wonderful creepy messed
plot little simple although suppose liked resolution interesting attempts create classic text adventure without requiring player typing kind mixed results perhaps one tantalizing things text adventures player input could anything unlike modern adventure games limited interact use item combine items like text parser hand involve creativity one favorite moments game final puzzle yahtzee croshaws chzo mythos episode text parser type something really didnt expect crosses mindwell got real kick end lucas artsstyle experience never really feel like get stuck even dont understand something could always combine objects something lets move forward pleasant exception couple times solve maze using riddles howeverit kind work bit nicer read dialogue way lucas artsstyle games feels like brisker pace dont watch walking animations time could see games style really fun phone tablet interactive lot interactive fiction tried platforms seem along lines verbose choose adventuresoften romance options guess would like try another game style surprising ploti mean certainly seen movies exact plot several times way black white era although end game nicely done also side note story really none feeling twin peaks dont know store page name drops practically humor little humor smile im sure intentional characters arent quirky nothing surreal ever happens yeah guess wouldnt recommend would willing try another game game engine would creative storyline
feel like game incomplete seems like designed bring puzzle quest match game play strategy game got limit budget programmed ai go map like puzzle quest fewer rpg elements space puzzle quest best think overstay welcome
wonderfully bonkers adventurerpg game difficult describe wonderful characters great sense humor many combinations weapons allies worth playing multiple times read psydra games announcement closing think might like game sure buy gone forever
theres another coop puzzle series called pretty similar set feels lot less polished perhaps even incomplete understand make idea bit challenging past within every puzzle exactly one person finds code always right front face relates person inserts place screen code could possibly go repeat times suppose prove person actually done guessed maybe little things happens like jump scare plot development process repeats big problem youre never asked figure puzzle together course theres even one code one entry station time theres never question next escape room games quite bit better even similar least difficulty thinking relate looking partner zxy bee person house one section game starts come alive section toward end relate codes threat timer feel partner actually working together thing story lot obvious cube escape games doesnt appear expand universe way guess id skip one
interesting film even novels days seem become simpler simpler spell everything independent games seem bounds storytelling pushed im thinking things like cat lady talos principal even moreso expansion leave things chew game provides three stories seem unconnected first symbolism begin see connections become plain end good also good pretty dark story end little complicated needs doesnt work well gameplay youll working gray matter way figuring story puzzles puzzle platformer additionally irksome slow characters move knights sections worst think idea girls game adventure game adventurers platformer knights action game zero skill involved knights combat moves push joystick right sometimes left mash attack button many sections every time screen fades away adventurer portions dread long youll spend knight like adventurer inspired either say easy girls portions best focused uncovering narrative moves slowest adds frustrations yeah compelling story poor gameplay guess put one
starts easy stays easy also lot work put making interface language independent results intuitive particular menu comes right click cell makes sense youll ever use
reminds bit old kongregate flash games suppose puzzle platformer category suspect several hours puzzles might get hard youve done easy ones kind tedious replay first screens looking new ways die thats basically puzzle find ending game ways die others several different ways deal dragon instance kind like enjoy humor slight changes world start noticing things make permanent changes find new ending screen fades away fades back start screen express little sigh
think one first games bought steam didnt review time back kind long load times made dread everytime enter new battle im trying much upgraded computer chassis keyboard mouse original remain much smoother experience theres much like game tactical eventually get repetitive also varied lot different battlefields offer different obstacles unlike rts sort battlefields points interest must control gain access spells bolster troops morale morale wins loses battle game decimating opponent although certainly helps idea quite like really adds another layer tactical depth game really shines campaign base game comes story campaign interesting lots flavor text quests go even played number times different paths good evil pagan christian cant bring play king arthur bad guy interesting choose old gods new youre done expansions offer two campaigns give something crusader kings lite experience youre free conquer map make friends however youd like hard recommend game highly enough especially since popular king arthur setting games rarely seem take seriously exceptions think infocoms quest excalibur really adapts sword stone spirit excalibur presumably sequel vengeance excalibur havent played better spirit excalibur though working game something like experiment side note people leaving game bad reviews glitches wish would say reviews computer specs game running perfectly im using windows nvidia gtx
normally wait finished game played much im going play posting review im upset game getting review bombed far seems like lot fun something like diablo bit automated interesting classes upgrades might alter review runs content quickly keeps interesting opening hour think going worth purchase
gremlins inc board game monopolylike theme perhaps plays like talisman dealt hand cards common deck use move around gremlin city earn resources complete goals attack enemies strategy games inspired arent slave roll dice must land next instead slave cards draw since card gives number spaces move allows plan ahead bit play cards way avoid bad spaces say theres bit problem players draw deck would prefer set like deck building game player started crap deck could improve buying better cards making sure maintain mix movement values would also help cards combo cards deck big feels unlikely youll see cards work together way could build deck cards work together beside point game fun lot different avenues explore like politics money prison experience dont think youll get bored quickly although would nice game bit shorter
enjoyed game lot figure pleasant sense humor enjoy way different paths level different endings satisfying reward exploration super special coins something like far two endings come back tomorrow another
quite bit fun three units one attacks things one either summon eggs create obstacles board hatch eggs variety low level units move fight one cast variety spells might strengthen low level units destroy egg allow pass space like unable move eggs units adds puzzlelike quality game otherwise would straight tactics also interesting many creatures seem underwater creatures maybe taking place beach store page suggests chess evolved im sure creatures take multiple hits kill spell system adds random element chess seems intentionally avoided think random element helps game dont use strategy different cards coming forces try different things
enjoyed pleasant sense humor boss fights staying close possible spamming attack also ring invincibility seemed bit overpowered much never bothered get super hatchet
enjoyed hour half variety liked look characters get annoyed spikes end though
puzzles game really good maybe first time dont like game metroidvania aspect puzzle rooms connected one giant map easy fall room youre ready leave little time find miles away huge journey ever want see room guess ill leave recommendation good game good know game doesnt particularly value time
bought pack archer pinball like show bobs burgers quite bit american dad okay loath family guy far tables go dont feel great telling story like marvel star wars bethesda alien tables feel like reward playing get sound clips references shows many quickly become irksome repetition even shows like archer maybe comes across best dont really feel like im completing spy mission get quite lot things happen table gives things explore tables remind one another everywhere hit ball another ramp associated another character shows suppose three bobs burgers closest ambitious assembling hamburgers guests bobs restaurant doesnt really run theme maybe like time management cooking games shoot pinball station station anyway shoot ramp enough times tables something happens maybe multiball thats games guess really love archer bad table others said annoy repetitive voices dont really recommend pack much better offerings pinball fx one thing id add nonarcher tables pack similar layout also marvel champions table women power pack feels like zen running ideas maybe thats switched recreations real pinball tables event champions better three tables force better archer id recommend getting pack instead one
bought got kick humor weird characters psydras game dark scavenger nothing like dark scavenger terms game play obviously terms humor setting however fun platformer smooth controls interesting level layout similar something like super meat boy hard doesnt feel repetitive never finished super meat boy however managed hours story carry though mostly shows assume intended dream sequences hallucinations fiddle rules game also boss fights collectibles first two add nice texture game however story im sold get client rat like thing dont clue angel demon floating eye thing game also im sure enormous labyrinth supposed space station im reminded scene galaxy quest sigourney weavers character complains writer put series crushers hallway bad writing refuses still give game props main character lgbt without feeling like make much big deal overall recommend gameplay really fun exploring mazelike layout looking secrets new exits always feeling like clue yet never feeling like dont know way forward really nice balance
wonderful demo inscryption might never played game didnt like pony island much felt similar several video games time particularly good example steam demo fest thing year tried inscryption delighted looked else designer made discovered thisand pretty good sale pulled trigger much better pony island ways appropriate played demo fest feels bit like demo fest move controlling character character inn play flash backs games arrived inn gives chance play lot short games say little different games inspired nice helps game still feel new however also bit easy without challenge maybe feels bit like walking simulator game even though way hold w key im really sure designer chose similarly main game connects smaller experiences takes guise adventure game puzzles throughout easy various arcade strategy challenges fact another level game glitches gives cheats help help arrives puzzles show youre even allowed try solve appear strange design choice game wants make feel like youre peeling back outer layers breaking rules discover underneath remember back puzzle games wanted exceptionally difficult theyd want force give go forums clues get didnt cheat complete monty pythons complete waste time instance really felt proud yet games probably wouldnt much thought put ending one well think best experience would make player work reward himher nowadays story telling improved challenge decrease one think maybe blame valve remember reading article portal said never wanted player feel stuck play testers much started heading wrong path would add lights something make sure player would never take wrong step dont know desirable wanted led around nose id watch movie read book putting thoughts challenge puzzle game one side certainly recommend game really delightful toy box im sure youll enjoy beginning end suppose one small complaint achievements seem fun try complete however game autosaves rather uses save files option play game way beginning guess im willing
like table different one another giving good variety buy packs champions immediately likable two kind reminds bobs burgers youve played table feels like every shoot ramp fights easy get feel unique one another didnt like aforce first started grow started use table nudges ball found way left outlanes think table designed intended nudge would say started im likely lose ball table goes straight middle hard keep control ball table find ball goes left right almost much goes fairly easy keep ball away wrong outlane nudges doesnt feel unfair spending time found liked table champions story really came across liked complicated story tell pinball neither tables anything totally unique good fear infinity gauntlet moon knight far marvel tables go cant imagine wont enjoy time
general im recreations real tables love real life pinball video pinball cant recreate experience playing real physical gadgets video pinball things real life pinball cant least take advantage well long time since zen studios made original table anxious play something new decided buy pack played arabian nights table real life loved id also played different companys recreation table steam zen frankly done much better job earlier attempt assets much higher resolution one thing easier see youre looking hitting ball next great table bunch different quests complete whats nice game thats based physical table manages convey stories youre playing go home gophers golf themed table two concepts go together like chocolate peanut butter really read rules one know get ball hole get good score since obvious arabian nights table learn ton fun third table cirque voltaire hadnt heard table got lot going like theres trapeze artist lock ball balloons pop ringmaster defeat idea story sure like visiting attractions three great games williams pack first one say theres lot filled great ideas give lot explore exhausted
well boring adventure game played find object code use obvious place repeat repeat repeat one section stuck single room bit better felt bit like room games maybe play overall reminded free phone games played called adventure escape least couple clever puzzles think like busy work good puzzles really need busy work puzzles give brain break think big one makes mind much even give bit relief also stories adventure escape better humor nice nothing enough sell nothing worth mentioning way plot hadnt gotten would asked refund guess dont mind much price
enjoyed setting puzzles bit easy compared say kings quest suppose main influence confined single screen nice touches throughout like nighttime screen becoming brighter turned raccoon showed game well thought ill looking forward main game
hmm think said review awakening good expansion really dont get hate expansion id give thumbs dont enjoy playing umbral choir hacking pain like extra chore every turns dont hate options gives complete dont get bother game works great without doesnt really change strategy none es expansions necessary already wonderful deep game others contain fun new different faction play faction different kinda boring espionage system chore something fun im going turn expansion dont hate much im going recommend buying
stories art great rewards slim really worth going way complete quests game many point really fill queue sit wouldnt turn wouldnt go way buy
best video game music along sword sworcery heroes might magic video game soundtracks ill put im playing
hissho ton fun play unique resource replaces approval basically works use approval variety useful things pass special laws instantly colonize new system example however uses approval planets slow crawl way earn approval back going fighting completing faction quests fun idea havent seen anything unique approval ratings game also added behemoths giant late game ships also things home depending one get like multifunction expensive take lot research really certain ultimately worth dont break game anything like pirate diplomacy vaulters expansion dont add much amazing game guess feel way expansion vaulters expansion new faction new mechanic meh
think game many quests interesting rewards slim ever bother completing non faction quest would anyway quests fill queue distraction bad writing good least good enough art great wouldnt turn wouldnt bother getting unless youre getting everything pack
game best music heres
much learn base game took forever pick expansions game would play certain point restart discovered mechanic didnt know first expansion bought also first one released think vaulters kind odd race tie expansion bit easier play races came base game unique way colonizing new systems streamlines process almost makes good pick new players even way things go races additionally expansion adds pirate diplomacy kind mixed feelings base game feel like pressure pirates forced think warfare bit earlier prepared meeting bellicose adversaries however pirate diplomacy largely seems work let put dangerous useful furthermore options pirates paying attack players doesnt big effect honestly may help forcing make powerful ships used attack dont know although dont like civ vii much game think barbarians slowly progress becoming minor civilization arent wiped bit interesting overall would recommend dont think pirate diplomacy bad enough hurt game think vaulters fun none es expansions add much favorite x game
one best expansions opinion race fine kinda cool mobile comes especially also additional quests dlcs make travel far flung corners map complete suppose maybe added quests specifically make faction competitive since seen people say powered multiplayer couldnt say play multiplayer cooperatively best part expansions altar auriga pearls pearls new resource shows winter sacrificed altar auriga variety bonuses bonuses nice little boosts feel necessary almost look forward winter winter dust eclipses later expansion add nice change pace game whereas winter originally mostly put breaks expansion much interesting dynamic
feels along lines downloadable content full expansion additions necessary like im sure id notice went away mostly adds legendary buildings like wonders civ think powerful also fewer find almost always get ai like count district dont require pop build allowing expand borders city bit rapidly also like districts also upgraded surrounded thats lot fun also legendary deeds basically competitive quests rewards nice bonus enough would every change tactics try achieve one happen get one would otherwise thats fine midway quality two things guardians powerful late game units maybe bit like behemoths endless space expensive build must researched first worth maybe think best thing look cool recommend expansion mostly wonders youre going skip expansion second bottom
played games cool espionage options kingdoms ii instance espionage although long time since played im certain interesting amplitude done endless space least actual chore strange little effect game unless youre actively pursuing plus takes hero heroes expensive want use mine pillage fine wartime option definitely worth price expansion endless legend expansion id give thumbs youre getting everything id recommend going make experience worse turned probably wont notice
cant comment much kapaku maybe play review expansion even hate playing would still heartily recommend downloadable content dust eclipses much fun strategy games add weather effects like keep things interesting turn turn love shrines reopening temporary bonuses pick map love something armies arent middle war would otherwise pressing end turn game nearly much certain massively popular x strategy game also pretty big thumbs
mykara urkans great urkans take place would minor civilization similar games pop map midgame unclaimed territories claim basically two ways deal bribe attack manage gain control get super powerful unit move around think adds lot interest gives something troops dont want fighting players mykara also interesting im sure quest line since didnt get far different path winning enjoy playing one beefy city still able claim resources outside border imagine easier play larger maps players unclaimed land since cant claim resources opponents area control bunch nations right top game fortunately none war hungry im bit boggled number poor reviews expansion even moreso last endless space expansion feel like people want expansion leaves game exactly way dont adjust tactics
overall liked game mystery interesting liked choosing follow group people group people around eavesdrop reminds actually text adventure suspect infocom think detective games well solve play many times well npcs game would different places times could follow one thing time obviously lot advanced feel like theres still way go genre particularly end game isnt satisfying think even end youre still pulled one way even following main mystery feels like tying loose end additional complaint one resolutions dont want talk would spoiler yeah game works works doesnt doesnt definitely think worth time like detective novels heres hoping tequilla works really hits park interactivity thought climax next time ill definitely playing
art wonderful great pleasure admire clearly detail like seeing different paintings together interacting animated premise game fun probably attracts people buy actual gameplay bit abbreviated however none puzzle require much thought fascinating characters drawn would personally like learn get interact theres book umberto eco called baudolino suppose similar feelings first half accurate portrayal middle ages last part character journeys east instead finding china finds weird creatures marginalia scribes books thats great idea unfortunately didnt much went home say feel bit similarly heres hoping sequel turns gorgeous art living world
guess feel like game bit derivative frog fractions surprising clicked randomly kongregate think find something like reviewers act like game play cant tell thats good telling like hidden anyway even store page surprises aside mostly two games one endless runner click left button jump right button shoot game tries appear like coding game isnt cursor progresses bottom screen put instructions path move left right warp well dont really care endless runner game simple really logic puzzle game method get harder make move instructions faster interest exploring devils computer levels think lot could done personally didnt find much interest shouldnt two games thought interesting involved involved exploring strange operating system interspersed puzzles include sorry james macdows would recommend would interested designers games especially inscryption looks promising heartily enjoyed demo
kind fun characters youre playing video poker carrying conversations although probably good two three plays start repeating maybe thats enough game cheap enough currently unavailable suppose doesnt matter
havent finished probably wont much store page talks puzzles seen far along lines trivia youll shown couple pictures text asked choose letters sigil spell pictures asking well either immediately recognize clues put answer type clues google maybe read wikipedia article type answer perhaps game gets harder get idea harder would obscure trivianot things would call puzzles would require another step get trivia mean say using facts clever way get answer inputting directly story isnt engaging either perhaps way presented reading womans dream journal looking documents psychiatric facility treated context doesnt feel immediate real someone completed game wrong puzzles look like going forward please reply review willing give game another chance
pretty fun easy controls youre constantly turn puzzle around look sides kinda feels bit like hidden object game mixed nonogram p give demo shot see like much im going buy level pack
easy never find ever get stuck unlike similar games pushed way though first world hoping would open harder things later worlds remain kind levels different color scheme method game increasing difficulty make levels enormous works get bit zonked clicking hexes obviously empty filled click wrong mouse button one really much better minesweeper variants maybe even nonograms better bet
difficult find positive things say game try nice bisexual main character acting okay thats far ill go really isnt game speak closest thing puzzle whole game telling pet rat get billfold couch gosh isnt pathetic also couple guess password puzzles breaking computers simple puzzle end game involving alien circuit board level anything myst dig maybe interactive movie quite popular days titles like walking dead life strange well usually involve choices make one choice end game decide two equally unsatisfying short endings get lack choice problem overall everything get every single movie clip unlocked order move includes wrong things like trying open bolted shut toolbox screw driver open dont new chapter trigger tedious really game click every single hotspot watch associated movies click every single hotspot youve made rounds enough times story progress ridiculous game instead movie might room choices affect game far three love interests wind pursue one far game let cant choose focus one game predetermined one end yeah really ought budget movie needed anything interactivity really hindrance getting involved story stumbling block havent clicked yet today ruins hope suspense general would say find horror games scarier horror movies forced open door something might jump movies gets scary disassociate bit game disassociation stopping things every minutes want play fmv game recommend gabriel knight best genre one best adventure games period also newer fmv games theres one steam called yoomurjaks ring im half way throughand intriguing story sort virtual reality feeling since allows walk around streets real city though youre google maps street view wouldnt recommend playing must know maybe try lets play video experience mindless clicking done
good first game series yoomurjaks ring plot far intriguing one still worth playing primarily puzzles second half think part problem game compared predecessor pacing detectiveinvestigation work first half game puzzles last half get bit bored done additionally really wish steam version option hungarian voice english subtitles english dubbing couple actors okay majority terrible also bit disappointing although bills full motion video game mostly look still images actors overall game unique learn bit hungarian scientists contributions physics nice might heard point hungarians found first evidence neutrinofor instancebut put context made care puzzles logical solvable without walkthrough though couple things take quite bit trial error since dont work way youd like dont really care walking around required solve quite often see supposed go even go proper place game wont let thing youve talked another person different room tells thing already know yes weak recommendation im sure better adventures games spend time suppose im clicking positive button review didnt regret time would like see another similar educational game series
recently played game wordland reminded one saw never gave one review lexica wordland variations word jumbles lexica bit harder letters outside board slid place main board slide blanks filled real dictionary words fun like sorts games newspapers like opens tiny window multitaskingfriendly
lot fun video makes look like might easy harder modes available start extra letters added make word quite obvious id recommend think youd like harder interesting spin word jumble
nakalim fun play wish runner positions academy useful playthrough doesnt seem like getting extra fleet game breaking nice bump players economically minded course getting costs quite bit dust give take expansion win none expansions strictly necessary would rank one right vaulters expansion hissho one umbral choir expansion one dont like find hacking stuff tedious
ill post complete review later saw couple reviews saying problems running windows perhaps updated since reviews works perfectly enjoy widescreen unlike original version game
tabletopia ton different board games generally good controls games cost money vast majority free playing people online prefer sites like boardgame arena forces rules rules easy take back moves someone doesnt understand something also dont run problems click thing something different intend person group spotty internet connection cause problems game piece may disappear people dont think thats really fault game also add browser version game seems work better steam version sometimes steam version hangs loading game fullscreen never problems browser version cant compare tabletop simulator costs apparently thing dont complaints cant imagine id get
think basic game mechanics combat abilities fun lot negatives comes level design story theres much backtracking game find chest might able open also find key also hidden around world whenever find key two go back refind chests couldnt pick time also many quests involve talking character received quest well pretty tedious walk quite large town area looking character everything repeated also playing normal difficulty combat bit simple id recommend start harder one note question experience point system theres area near beginning game flying attack thing get chest far level difficult pull empty air enemies must leave screen try well normal platforming game without experience points trying thing get fine trying failing probably gained half dozen levels level gives enormous stats boost im definitely overpowered nearby monsters experience point system game like make monsters area tough think appropriate players skill level
nice pixel art nice music nothing interesting gameplay story suppose free ill give positive review hopes designer makes something interesting little encouragement
although think pretty good app long ago lichess online much better option uses ai youve finished game generate analysis game afterward help improve also puzzles large community youre ready playing humans suppose isnt much review app isnt original game competing lot applications thing better
well havent finished game yet see lot reviews saying puzzles one solution program accepts one havent seen single problem yet think developers would save lot bad reviews theyd included enough chess engine show people wrong supposed solutions think games great fun hope making better comes end game actual chess since know checkmate two moves know look look find real game difficult dont know far away checkmate might
im player reasonably good mid game chess least relatively unskilled players usually keep advantage captures never good pinning king end things fall apart unless still two rooks rook queen program lets practice end game getting better seeing king cant move different pieces besides rooks used check mate something could added perhaps beating levels could collected pieces used check mate could look one see made patterns

supraland wonderful feels bit like mario talos principle like puzzles art style attractive complements story nicely power ups unique although one think could inventiveness use get beam lets connect two objects pull together right click despite mechanic included dont think ever one called use instead use pull objects like grappling hook bit odd functionality even told tutorial overall asked often think using combining tools disposal unique ways particularly final boss battle puts portal shame game big surprisingly big almost big keep finding away puzzle trying solve lot time get back jump pads go place place quickly without ingame map youre never sure fastest route im making small complaints ill say largest combat mean fine happens often wish things would maybe stay dead left area came back could still stay dead forever one get various power ups close lairs also power ups could come sooner tedious always pausing kill things jumping around finding things figuring puzzles lot fun im done game never needed walkthrough yet felt parts took quite figure finding final chests take time nicely extend length game map would useful many chests left area would nice even somewhat limited use seems many last ones involve dropping mountains dividing areas
dont really get game lot work gone art level design gameplay paired everything automated point decisions tactical otherwise player make
frustrating aspects story isnt interesting strangely violent games sort protagonist incapacitate enemies one goes around killing rampage main problem story slowest cutscenes ever forced sit cut scenes also dialogue general odd worth explaining talk somebody first must watch sort silent movie rudimentary drawings showing person saying slow every stage staying screen far longer needs though isnt enough narrator slowly explains saw think maybe concept pictures maybe playtesting people trouble decyphering definitely good idea story rescue princess shaman case bad guy sort based man would king suppose doesnt really make sense case since invented shamans king rather someone civilized world dont really get would make drunk power desires shamans imbued outside plot game generally good suppose side scrolling adventure game footsteps something like dizzy id say good probably better since pick one inventory item time failings including blind jumps would normally kill required proceed false wall walk metroidvania game things would hide bonuses like extra missiles might fun find twice cause go walkthrough one cases inadvertently saw solution puzzle hadnt put lot thought yet myriad smaller problems like timing interacting enemies quite expect way much back forthing caves blacksmith forest level game fast travel platforms dont think ever useful places suppose sort recommend though theres much competition genre want play platform adventure game focus puzzles rather platforming youll probably enjoy frustrated also story tedious art pleasing

played free levels extremely easy think creators game make couple complicated ones available free version let people know like sort game however tons grid players awesome would recommend game controls presentation like generally really dont like levels grid isnt multiple ten least initial levels dont include extra rows columns put zero makes difficult see quickly many spaces count also grey number put x locking makes harder see whats done isnt add many tiles youve blackened holding mouse cool feature counts new squares youve put entire set squares dubious use thats bit iffy good job making community designed levels free
really like spectromancer cards available beginning match although randomly selected factions cards similar tabletop card game dominion works makes much strategic gameplay hoping card need drawn eventually game get old master becomes something numbers game computer components least dozen hours id highly recommend game maybe base game since doesnt long enough legs last expansions

much enjoyed way avoiding indie platformer fatigue however sure cut rest interesting story puzzles surprising ideas liked way story told minimum dialogue quite dialogue whatsoever another world keeps pace think puzzles fairly good particularly ones turn generators although mostly dont resemble sort situational puzzles another world except maybe ones involving bounty hunter much enjoy exploring ruins fooling around machinery negatively ideas didnt work well engine instance programming puzzle couldnt see entire area one time basically put single new command time see robot ended add one command run robot engine similarly tripped desert chase toward end normal game youd easily change lanes hitting direction one precisely find lane continuous movement real chore platforming bit difficult particularly lengthy questionably necessary sequence end overall game blast real winner story entire life one event life
hemmed hawed leaving review cheap often sale played found wasnt suppose could someone else reread description game steam store realized id bought first place solve puzzles begin engage epic science fiction narrative written humour passion genre arent really puzzles collect things use obvious ways like rpg without combat like adventure game thought id leave review warn adventure game lovers dont care puzzles want watch interactive story might like although even perspective theres control story goes even far whether trust prisoner
thought one going walking simulator rather proper adventure left unplayed long time received humble bundle artistic games turns escape room forest game similar cube escape series series like quite lot story interesting self contained unlike cube escape seems still working resolution quite liked areas characters seemed unrelated playing eventually connected unorthodox manner best part game involved brook although one puzzles complete portion box thinking sort puzzle thought didnt belong game ended resorting ingame hints rolled eyes solution took things everything else works well atmospherically liked map encyclopedia lot didnt care movement much wish clearer paths didnt keep watching arrows show letterbox portion screen overall feels like early project designer going places would definitely recommend
bugs lets get way first sometimes youll put correct answer puzzle game wont recognize happened times first time moved things thought answer must require nuance wasnt seeing second time awful spent maybe hour checking everywhere high low things might missed relating puzzle finally turned computer frustrated next day turned started searching fun put thought might answer worked think youve done something correctly recognizing save trouble restart game top save game corrupted epilogue played hours according steam cant log save game title screen says played hours guess wont see ends im least time soon im still giving game good review maybe shouldnt people may less forgiving much want game two big myst games came recently obduction simple punishing loading screens time especially puzzles involved teleporting quern hard color blind person dont know games refuse give options also found art one boring one wonderful puzzles hard like hidden object element occupy stuck larger puzzles wish hidden object puzzles better cheat shimmer completely useless eventually want give looking coins
theres lot like primordia think negatives outweigh positives mostly problems art monotone brown hard know youre looking fact puzzles light memorable puzzles whole game small set puzzles involving searching archive good rest far simple test gray matter ever get stuck simply couldnt pick one brown thing background characters good kind humorous scifi wish however serious scifi premise interesting thing think taken far robots human stereotypes comedy
full nonsensical puzzles make sense obnoxiously mopey protagonist
know reviews online sites steam reviews keep telling wonderful game keep plugging along expecting see dont art style blandly homogenous never feel much like youre exploring somewhere new story sparse puzzles far think little stretched vast world think im going go buy new la mulana see scratches platforming itch instead
super nintendo sams room trailer game kinda knew wouldnt like store page said adventure game puzzles decided buy pack tacoma interested right dont like enough story characters opinion things dont make lot sense like fort still set living room one house clean red herrings would actually made interesting plot delivered parents room mess instance thought perhaps break business possible ghost apparently makers game agree sentiments grandfather nasty letter son discovered basement authors today cloud work much plot people well opinion things happening people heres hoping like tacoma better
much waiting repetition game think could liked turn based
point name dropping hamlet nothing say play guess expected sort parody theyve borrowed three names claudius murdered hamlets parents
basic idea captain ship cant make everyone happy think thats good idea telltale system least doesnt work guardians galaxy kinda makes entire crew fussy prima donnas cant actually make decisions sure know complain things end going also jokes tend land bit surprise finishing hilarious tales borderlands looking guess different script writers fun atmosphere lost kinda thought guardians break actually maybe gamora drax rejoin infinity watch p
wonderful one best telltale games havent played lot borderlands bit borderlands okay really sort game world sure works story driven setting one comedy games humor consistently lands liked plot twists didnt figure stranger made sense thing suppose didnt care game gave idea could side jack didnt really follow dont care much false choices also wish puzzles along way sometimes game opens lets control character push analog stick forward situations would nice puzzles show sometimes adventure games make mistake feeling like always need puzzles thats end stupid things like inflatable duck puzzle longest journey catmoustache puzzle gabriel knight maybe id like one good ones made sense otherwise focused strongly delivering story maybe day happy medium come yet stars great ride
game wonderfully inventive puzzles well integrated scifi world takes place overarching story nothing havent seen however takes end game learn characters integrated story mystery still works time put control character forced make action might want particularly frustrating sort game putting brain use solve problems think several solutions dont find unethical cant try things worst cases game goes great lengths try explain characters motivation fact providing flashback scenes still wasnt totally convinced obviously difficult explain without giving spoilers dont know puzzles great story problems maybe wouldnt bad novel film rather game puts control finally dont like end style finale theres lot going characters lives end dont really need cliffhanger feel invested possible sequel actually putting cliffhanger limits possibilities sequel characters could dealt anything sequel deal amounts loose ends
puzzles challenging comparison samorost compared earlier titles subgenre adventure game expect alice interactive museum monty pythons complete waste time blue ice quite liked art characters wish story told among short probably enjoy hours never think game get sale stumped one puzzle towards end game refenced something several scenes back didnt remember id supper meantime used clever ingame hint system worth missing puzzle use liked idea also liked game didnt feel need walk tutorial use rest functions magnifying glass liked less well way going toward top screen would open inventorybut sometimes click things annoying guess give mild thumbs hopes complicated puzzles future installment
doesnt much ending parts story explained credits unless expected take things face value mystery case fantastic allow story hold meaning also dialogue annoying annoyingly delivered scroll appears slowly going delivered slowly voice acted otherwise let us read pace meanwhile puzzles really simple fetch quests require traipse back forth screens like art worlds seem like something little girl could come perhaps idea dialogue well people really need say interesting things keep interest adult strong possibility sequel make story worth effort without explained without inventive difficult puzzles dont think worth time
wonderful certainly best game played wadjet eye always thought bit second tier entertaining enough lacking worthwhile puzzles developed narrative game lucky played bought first four games pack thought werent good premise series interesting seemed bit wasted none mysteries ghostmedium duo solving particularly interesting dont get wrong cant skip first four games play arent actually bad forgettable fluff hand thought individual mysteries well done mystery affecting everyone good motivation werent pure villains even though people villainous indeed liked sad appropriate ending highly recommended
really like cam corder visual style however think needs least illusion control draw one reasons liked penumbra amnesia penumbra weapon weapon turned utterly useless made feel like might able something really put story
dull pointless experience bit like myst without puzzles next story suppose must try heres hint dont ever bother explore path perhaps see interesting house intriguing cave figure moving distance none lead anything slightest interest
easily best game rusty lake made far although settings previous premium titles intriguing thought bit easy side one strong difficulty level nicely ties together earlier flash games cohesive plot particularly like navigating brain mini game would love possibly see spin game ideas explored also good job achievements time giving clues find encouraged play game whereas previously achievements seemed bit annoying find
fun see places character games brought life visuals quality level high probably wont win awards story however
suppose good proof concept creator make functioning adventure game similar last door theres enough make worth especially slow walking back forth along similar corridors must level hallucinogen fun navigating maze changed based whether high perhaps like could explored sequel less deliver inventory item
slow animations make game unbearable also screen layout betrays games moblie roots really dislike hold end turn button rather click think fantasy world bland also problem physical game marvel superheros inspired replacement
kings israel rip board game pandemic doesnt really add anything pandemic instead simplifies bit one type disease sin grounds want give poor review pandemic isnt steam yet best want play fun sit minutes digital version pandemic come probably change review positive negative edit pandemic steam bare bones version possible leaving better option
would love computer version zooloretto play friends multiplayer earth would play push luck game computer
remember orginal nintendo game lot less frustrating iteration strange never able beat whereas seemed easier aggravating simple things like many cutscenes inability fast forward dialogue fact skipping cutscenes means slowly fading pause menu selecting skip cutscene slowly fading back aggravating slows gameplay especially redo area many times progress like original quite difficult unless youre playing easy probably breeze two sittings like sprite work boss battles remixed music still hate walking space reveals gems must turn around go back pick probably one worst ideas game ever

age rivals basically ccg version wonders played kongregate decided liked enough buy full game
bit like watching trailers scifi original films dont want see
really liked memoir reason doesnt scratch itch slow paced think perhaps unless amassed enough spellpoints spells boost character extremely unlikely hit plot completely uninteresting
engaging mix interesting choose adventures deck building return sequel added overarching story new combat system new combat system difficult get feel first much harder block game first one pressed attack pressed defend defend override essentially must wait attack animation completed press next button think good different ever skill required boss fights original game effect making combat seem slow surprised much like series generic fantasy setting wouldnt appeal distance im actually playing reminds lone wolf conan lord rings something thankful often inspiration creature designs favorite mages first game spellbooks open mounted armor also unlocking cards fun lets progress even fail overall mission allows game difficult frustrate player
ultimately game isnt really want roguelike lot unlock good dungeon remains less floor floor increasing difficulty pretty wellwritten nice connects endless space endless legend together games reviewed positively think youll feel like wasted time played much
controls feel bit slow really like level set like big maze lots surprises course creatures charming
wonderfully delightful far away best game played since talos principle game beautiful multitude surprising environments interact wih puzzles interesting ways theres lot think audio video clips youre walking around im starting try piece together happened island im witness wish could stay night finish work morning edit finished game wrong story piece together people complain ending point really worst ending ever seen game worse think abruptly saying end still great set puzzle nice look
highest profile brain good board games probably least favorite seems least challenging bought games together pack much enjoy length variety ideas much like playing solo board game id recommend pack anyone think maybe one would benefited solo game go quickly someone else resources would add little welcome pressure proceedings still interesting set mechanics worth complete set
pretty lot interesting mechanics first got game didnt steam controller really didnt work well mouse keyboard happened load today quite impressed think ill interested learn story see new environments
fun little randomized puzzles suppose play kill commanders fun comes trying set combos wonder would like two player
plot atmosphere good tasks game asks complete simple feel like chores suppose id rather read comic perhaps might still given thumbs sometimes okay style substance conclusion bit disappointing guess ill go play gabriel knight
bought sale still feel cheated many screens see preview hardly anything id call puzzle hoping dig got something probably free promo real game
rather repetitive platformer think levels okay digging get like putting breaks suppose id hoped mining town building portion worked sort economic sim underbaked would try another game developers though good pieces
quite enjoy art story think might like game based screenshots probably
got hexcells together bundle recommend skipping earlier games series starting one much easy head scratchers pleasing presentation always negative thing infinite mode rather pointless puzzles many clues youll figured faster click mouse
strong game visual sense surrealistic rooms house whats less strong way story delivered puzzles sense horror story delivery possibly works reason lacking horror lot horror games fear comes prospect someone hunting use wits get away bad guy mind things startle see something unexpected hands tied goals get end passage scares dont build ephemeral still recommend fun see house change towards beginning game pretended doctor stranges house end house leaves maybe would better designers hadnt gone horror instead wonder feeling games best moments evoke
goes barely changing vistas story doled smallest bits possible puzzles action honestly im giving finger getting cramp holding w key dont know im near end thought near end turned night day much longer hold w key anything happen ever see anything rock pillars remnants russian expedition edit decided finish since supposed short game hours left environments continued look different colors textures stretched far story forever told found note pages lazy gives sense one adventure wasnt playing one people left note pages many older games better ways delivering story im thinking say penumbra given story guy end walky talky walking furthermore story ever got remotely interesting last two sections know little interesting much game walking simulator nothing look platformer controls rubbish survival horror never trouble adventure game puzzles story telling game story incredible sparse going achievements log entries paragraph long even many superfluous horrible glitchy ugly time sink
took hours complete game perfectionist rating im really sure enough justify price usually think games worth dollar hour never gets even little difficult put squares tells next theres never ever higher order thinking like might expect say battleships hardest thing retraining switch right left clicks used minesweeper proside well presented calming music
like idea making snake puzzle game hate see little maze really reason
quite bit fun interesting varied make dexity puzzles elements also gets quite hard
poorly written dialogue paired uninteresting combat
room series five puzzle boxes must open difficult still fun wish puzzles would worked together way end opening bit anti climactic mystery lovecraft nonsense think anyone would enjoy playing cheap price
mind games features good selection traditional puzzles right away challenging end scale would recommend ignoring negative reviews seem think early nim puzzle impossibly hard think would like sorts puzzles shown screenshots like game think peg solitaire hard want totally original puzzles id keep looking negatives fact appears way play window cant select puzzle play must play order also poor translations rules puzzles
dont really get point time travel arent going real historical periods game time travel generic fantasy land filled dragons elves dwarves fairies everything simple plot makes sense also dont care large area must traipse back forth objects pick
nice art much going plot department puzzles things weve seen
astral heroes new card game series similar card games early ones astral masters spectromancer free worth trying see like style game feel like step back spectromancer spectromancer got cards could possibly play right beginning game could proceed along longer term strategy hand draw end turn like normal card game frankly lot less interesting core game good id go buy spectromancer
pointless activity havent clue plot supposed
dripping style definitely worth spending hour tells sad story brother sister bit close one another aspects bit vague due translation particularly credits sequence interesting id love see developer
extremely rote ho adventure nothing going plot certainly worse ones need something original get recommend someone else purchase
game starts really well intriguing plot interesting somewhat unlikeable main character much likeable love interest kind stalls dialogue good plot line never really comes together particularly intriguing way memory puzzles novel first become bit waring end never really develop anything fact generally puzzles never much excited really enjoyed cognition immensely course liked jane jensens gabriel knight lot fell flat said thought characters well realized would visit another game series suppose still give positive review hopefully new game less innuendo malachai boyfriends relationship
id hope based publisher really inferior hidden object game really poorly written plot placing objects instead finding one mildly interesting thing distinguish ho games
pretty fun liked characters doesnt really anything special puzzles though
definitely good art sure experience really falls apart game portion arent really puzzles speak anything nearly along lines puzzle like pulling levers adjusting hands cuckoo clock proper time incredibly simple game wandering around hoping one rooms youve passed times something different slow story really never get anywhere even last act made mind numbingly slower giving nothing nice effects pixel artalthough mixed bag overall crudeness makes sometimes hard see might worth clicking light shadows art nicely rendered aural landscape good except last chapter seem forgotten edgar allen poehp lovecraft pastiche interesting puzzles present direction game less vague would recommended
since puzzles hidden object games similar one another think story interest one practically nonsense
cognition absolutely wonderful mysterythriller well plotted story satisfying play everyone thinks might like definitely buy want make plain everything else say complaints constant frustrations beginning end astounding towards beginning game design issues last two chapters mostly technical issues fact last two chapters froze many times felt like id played twice end suspense primarily situated whether would make way cut scene would hang lines dialogue particularly troublesome last two parts wonderful genius got thought game good good still life first two chapters lot poor busy work puzzles two absolutely obnoxious characters csi guy coroner horrible idea giving cell phone always forcing actually go visit person talk like cell phone taunting bad thing time spend watching slow jerky walking animations sets large three things interact could easily fit screen invariably must walk back forth slowly jerkily least two screens find theres still something need another location completely worst offender beautiful apartment chapter notice im compelled compliment even complaining apartment spend time must walk back forth around kitchen counters islands coffee tables dining tables fill screen game seems mostly find pixels worth floor space click get erica moving right direction problem plot suggestion throughout last chapter opportunity decide happens certain characters whether kill bring jail im fine game decides happen fine fact suggested youd agency game good busy work puzzles generally awful unbelievable central puzzles always wonderful way various psy powers work always inventive intricately planned plot well done never disappointing like dont like good guys dislike bad guys cognition wonderful gem really phoenix studios shape
boring vampire story ever written top game clearly intended played full screen resolution graphics squished top bottom remains case even play windowed mode resolution poor hidden object portion puzzle portions easy beside point
well done think similar one another terms gameplay lot repeated puzzles particular terms plot one different im bit loss part grim legends series first one vaguely fairy taleangela carter feeling second fairy tale seven swans one nothing fairy tales seems inspired steam punk first welcome change played found story bit irritating play girl amnesia fighting people whose sins opened possessed dimensional monsters story rather nonexistent throughout whole thing also moral seems bit based pandoras box boy story causes trouble investigating occult submitting natural order point view always taken antiscience still game smooth ever good hidden object adventure always wish logic puzzles harder versions puzzles scaled difficulty would nice
good second offering grim legends series previous game bit longer felt inventory bit engaging good time waster always liked fairy tale one based odd present story mystery well known one
cant imagine would disappoint fans hidden object genre nice visual ideas theyve done good job animating theres good deal traditional inventory based adventure game puzzles enough id say game might appeal tradtional adventure gamers well never gets hard besides theres lots stuff find isnt necessary unless want get achievements like well story okay think might benefitted bad guy distinct personality obvious motive abyss would like see would ability choose difficult versions logic puzzles one point instance one puzzles must light streets placing lights cant see one another well anyone done puzzle one game particularly easy version possible make sort puzzle quite difficult couldnt three versions logic puzzle one difficulty would change set art forth hidden object games start start buying
seems bit much game completed less hrs general lack luster experience puzzles impede progress easy really considered puzzles easily find thing put obvious hotspot hope decoding alien language toward end really decode figured looking first alien console didnt take much brain power considering dearth puzzles thought regarding along lines interactive fiction stuff weve seen countless times particularly reminded episode battlestar galactica starbuck crash lands alien world hot wire cylon drone get away would like sci fi adventure games im going give good review genres part
definitely played child cant remember called game fun enough arcade game nothing really adds orginal formula pleasing graphics might nice see different level types
oh remember
certainly best broken sword game far one easily recommendalthough reservations despite loving adventure games say never really big fan broken sword series first one alright due similar subject matter felt lot like third gabriel knight game worse puzzles less charasmatic leads second broken sword game makes list worst adventure games third fun enough pleasure came unusual platforming stealth areas games done much better never really jumped buying one turns mistake first serpents curse gorgeous didnt mind bunch simple puzzles little waste time first act loved seeing every environment much attention detail art loved inside bijouxs apartment instance caught personality even better dialogue second act puzzles improve quite bit act include one puzzle axed involving cockroach level cat hair mustache gb inflatable duck get railway key longest journey however excepted act nice assortment puzzles including particularly memorable ones must decode map decipher hieroglyphic language plot fairly interesting throughout bit safe goes exactly way youd expect never really explores new territory okay story dont mind hearing one allows artists dazzle also negative side number tiresome comic relief characters uninspiring willtheywontthey dynamic leads especially considering must agree reviewers control george much nico enough really balance one place control nico makes little sense scene george nico must pose insurance investigators george insurance investigator daily life yet nicowho reportertakes lead later possibly right scene george interrogates man come see nico report wrote robberywouldnt make sense nicothe reporterto conducted interview bizarre course numerous scenes throughout wouldnt matter character control except almost always george ah well suppose little thing really buy art puzzles second act also story characters shouldnt annoy enough keep enjoying
best heroes might magicalike get hands love inventive troops different armies suggest different strategies like game forces keep changing troops many available hire forces find strategies opposed something might like another game add tons invention plotnot main plot dull dishwater everything happens way zombie brides pinnocchio like whales theres always something unexpected around corner negative end ruined genre cant get hommlikes spent gosh darn long one none others seem quite level imagination
usually reserve reviews finish game confident think ton fun im playing hard puzzles though thats bit exaggeration medium combat although could probably bump hard since havent trouble either think good mix exploration action dialogue could use work thats complaint quite like combat limited areas know going bad guys isnt like similarly themed game ball handle combat exploringpuzzling time complaint easy leave area accidentally never return possible missed secrets never know wouldnt mind confirmation screen one tells percent completed area
dont know ever disliked game hard enjoyed fair share tough platformers actraiser la mulana daemon crest favorite platformer something hands dont get perhaps unusual control scheme somewhat imprecise feeling jumping hit detection dont seem make progess except grinding getting upgradesmaybe thats point maybe thats game roguelike like play longer character suppose also world takes place generic actually funny sense humor
liked game still like dont know theres much reason upgrade bought game unless want support developer hes nice guy havent bought game yet definitely go version great roguelike puzzle game reminds bit oasis uncover fog war maximize stats complete quests quickly find spouse youve used moves great time waster theres lots stuff explore
personally cant get way story presented really like endless cutscenes super nintendo rpgs might feel differently
absolutely enchanted first chapter say agree bad reviews time much fun watching friends starve death suppose idea replay game things order save everyone doesnt make fun
extremely short one vaguely interesting puzzle one involving monkey statues rest things weve seen inventory puzzles strictly understand youve done youve done variety story ispoorly implemented positive side final scene leaves things bit open interpretation sequel might better opening act also like microids games pretty really three scenes facility island temple also achievements dont seem working since find testaments testament achievement says found zero
absolutely delight like levels short filled ideas keeps wondering happen next
game surprisingly wonderful puzzles fun difficult music animation top notch story poignant funny voice acting best ever heard game think psychonauts games ever laughed loud part makes humor work selfeffacing realizes weak earlier kings quest games keeps gently poking fun cant recommend experience highly enough
nice art story areas large must spend much time tracking back forth looking items missed also theres simply much dialogue story characters interesting amount listen renders bit boring bit strange sorts problems previous daedalic games played chains satinav memoria smooth affairs
wander around find orb planet game dont know pretty thats might bored already still give thumbs art perhaps approached like walking simulator puzzle game
steam version unplayable lucky enough get running must modify desktop setting steam controller work game awful time trying walk straight line look direction youd like view perhaps give play keyboard frustrations
fun light puzzle game wish minimum number moves shoot included level pursuit would made puzzles bit hard extended length game
quite fun basically cooperative boardgame playing roles particularly similar elder sign theme quite fun wish werent doesnt play laptop well sort game made played desktop also wish could see precisely room looking roll without entering room though back go somewhere else
absolutely love thematic strategic unique easy learn variety strategies think im going go buy physical version
game lot good stuff isometric platforming hacking computers upgrading robot interesting story somehow still manages feel repetitive point probably wont actually finish think rpg portion falls apart id still recommend enough good ideas make feel like everything could possibly want
maybe dont really get listen little snippets music completed song compare snippets music eventually put correct order dont know really puzzle since either piece template sound correct doesnt vaguely similar music puzzle game call musaic box think executes idea bit better neither really figured yet music okay dont know genres electronic music id say pretty mellow nice levels songs rarely repeat phrase exactly duration would say buy music songs short clips im sure whether comes soundtrack
short game story interesting particularly well told however credit quite beautiful puzzles generally good unique one another suppose probably worth picking sale
lot fun good writing acting based around fantasy weve yet im sure ever seen written like way uncover things search terms bit like actually grilling subject nice details like way make lcd screens look like low resolution cathode ray tubes sometimes catch odd reflections
generally like interactive fiction like putting detours planned route
game radar added humble bundle quite like interactive fiction game snoop around girls computer thought sounded like provocative premise find stumble upon clues lead mystery perhaps puzzles must figure password unlock archives always like kinds puzzles adventure games none game nothing discover see girls life poems spattering selfies instead game almost immediately starts story would made sense short film fact final scene requires anyway good things writing sound like girl trying sound cute acting fine art graphic would like see another game designer hope little higher concept id also recommend play portal digital love story road gehenna expansion talos principle see done concept exploring peoples computers message boards forums chats
game short completed hours according steam said also cheap recommend worth sending coins people brought us wonderful free games universe game beautiful art nice story telling techniques pheasant rabbit particularly memorable
endless legend perhaps best civlike game played mostly gorgeous environments interesting races multitude things discover races play extremely differently one another gives game far replayabilty civ differences minor would fine even didnt look races special ability also focus adventuring kind like age wonders never left clicking end turn wait human opponents wage interminably long wars finally city management interesting allowing put citizens work different ways complaint wonky combat system makes perhaps many choices interesting think general troops think best additional thoughts id like update review first time played game way end largest map size additional thoughts game small maps opponents take one two empires one stand true lot x games maybe part traditionally preferred smaller scenario based xs like heroes might magic disciples age wonders sprawling history world things like civilization rewards defeating enemy games vast real world war effort depletes resources sides games winner gets brand new fully built cities addition eliminating enemy might previously putting pressure must better way games crusader kings lot interesting ways keep player dominating globe principally ruler dies depending governmenttype everything gets divvied least new ruler starts lot lower favorablilty among nobles old guy dont know similar things would work endless legend civ since dont people underneath games although interesting government political ideas explored endless space trending right direction overall challenge game progressed nice ideas later game quest rewards increased proper rate always make amount worth would give rarer resources even heroes super powered artifacts many ways quests big part makes endless legend interesting turn turn comparison civ feel like lot game waiting get done many quests however makes blur together whereas think amplitude mostly improved legend space think quests better game game also many quests filling queue rewards arent really enough make pursuing worthwhile since arent cool artifacts game dont momento quests would allow think earned helping minor faction well still highly recommend game even definitely recommend finishing real star game incredible variety factions makes playing unique game one box think play see theres way could lose go next final note come side liking combat system helps speed things kind like power hands level game tactical combat ai good enough stand human players troops seem make choices helps level playing field
generally like sort game enchanted graphics better games nature dont feel like one particularly distinguishes think story pull would like little besides point also maybe computer time jump command doesnt make bit delayed restart level certainly soured experience sure affects review general platforming works bit like braid older click create games doesnt smooth feeling expect retail game
kind weak recommendation solo rpg ported computer company done really done good job still recommend even though rather overpriced like book based game really short finish one sitting perhaps see much youd like two three playthroughs fact superior lone wolf books available free world sorcery sadly generic would recommend buying pretty good sale best part game inkle added combat system pick strength attack based think opponent might next opponent tells written text descriptions fights use choose best course action usually want hits slightly stronger opponents cant beat opponent must defend comes together beautifully much fun throwing dice part quite like game role play bit perhaps trade world seeming particularly real leaves writing lot terser lone wolf compare often several series kid found lone wolf memorable sorcery given quite options direction travel whether help someone kill makes want play game see another choice may bring worst part game probably cast spells wish game would supply list spells might want cast rather spell takes lot flipping back forth spell book isnt even particularly easy access often take warrior path fun shouldnt case game called sorcery
absolutely loved liked story improved plenty humor along way end thinking different angles say came lot nihilistic existential leanings predecessor didnt really feel good things end suppose expected game called road gehenna puzzles seemed easier else im better stars definitely easier really nothing game required turn come back later also point solved lot puzzles ways realized later intended developers instance figured put laser relay top incredibly high pillar egyptian world took many steps including setting another laser top puzzle floating disk pillar however see pretty much anywhere level including pit made puzzles bit basic suspected wasnt intended pillar jump outside level secrets around edges though interesting similarly aqueduct world managed get box outside one level let easily retrieve one star realized wasnt intended solution later hop along top level aqueduct came upon unnecessary fan similar circumstances wonder solving puzzles developers intended made playthrough easier harder overall pillar puzzle probably hardest thing completed game
expected game card game elements doesnt really yet even though expected fun im really sure basically action roguelike fight fights upgrade equipment get new fights scenarios let make choices choose adventure style surprisingly interesting monster background design im sure didnt make sound interesting wish could keep coming back
played first episode seems promising way switching inventory items changes deck seems borrowed card hunter im sure story engaging enough get buy rest episodes least full price make interested film tied havent seen maybe like buy rest
feelings one bit mixed general give recommendation indie game mixed feelings lot ideas think storytelling particular didnt work stories spread jumbled many hours play difficult necessarily remember characters time time came even three protagonists problem couldnt always recall details true one second thing didnt work warp zones entries spread exits marked map always seemed better use walk straight going rather possibly walk distance break crystal great feeling exploring real space isnt map castles everywhere connected everywhere else barriers also quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces music wonderfully accompanies knytt pitter patter running jumping satisfying finally idea game mrated one characters lesbian find making game mrated simply lesbians exist extremely offensive
lot fun well worth price reminds bit gravity bone sense humor portal definitely worth price
liked gravity bone better stylish lot fun
extremely repetitive
amazing cant get every moment filled wonder havent much fun since driftmoonnot similar games neither let anything get old see one thing move next theres much see wish hadnt quick move forward beginning im sure missed lot always return play whole thing negatively say didnt care ending found bit predictable manipulative
cute memorable characters wellcomposed plot adventure gameplay quite nice although wont find puzzles ingenious nice variety though one puzzle felt unfair getting snake puzzle look didnt feel bad done suppose game reminds bit loom much satisfying complete experience game felt bit like demo game could would imagine everyone would enjoy hope sequel let us explore land beyond plague dam learn bit culture
although like sort game extremely slow movement character frankly dont see character move obnoxious also much dialogue many simple puzzles interest story every strong puzzle shows unlike puzzle agent never hard puzzle youre willing slog mud may worth also save game disappeared several times
like zachtronics games probably like problems first precisely whats tin says youre rewriting corrupted code segments seen far take input values things put really looking whats wrong exisiting code since youre writing programs things actually make programs actual things ill play bit later update review ideas change like zachtronic games far seems like work puzzle requires increasingly complicated things clever
make sure get reincarnation rather renaissance game massively updated dont think selling version anymore
would like point really annoying thing youve completed game theres way go back collect achievements without starting scratch particularly annoying didnt even know secret rooms id finished game noticed hadnt gotten steam achievements good writing good core gameplay beautiful environments however dont fooled youre mostly paying style substance game rather short hours puzzles never really rise beyond medium difficultythis fish fillets toughness really single room even gave pause might case someone else felt stupid realized simply begin puzzle different location room considering short length hard puzzles problem secret rooms handled im bit fence maybe shiny packaging wins game really joy look think
best kicking simulator could ever spend money think reason reviewers ragged time games pedigree wanted serious rpg instead got incredibly enjoyable action game spend time dropping goblins traps kicking orcs cliffs reviewers right story script garbage overly serious overly cliche sexist garbage defined might magic since ubisoft acquired
personally feel bit fence one visual design quite intriguing like way areas connected one another also really like way hint system incorporated ever really needed sometimes would look hint puzzle solved puzzle see page hint book looked liked dont care theres really nothing going story theres much dialogue really next none game showing us world listening woman complain husband using much salt hamburgers stuff nothing also traditional inventory style puzzle must complete get combinationslider blockwhat sorts puzzles bit annoying running back forth screen give item person tedious go ladders wait world rotate thats quite fun first time new area id rather somehow warp guess even better everything need unlock next puzzle screen beautiful shallow suppose buy want something look want crack brain hard puzzles laugh witty dialogue
really fun exhilarating jump grapple ledge ledge kind feeling got prince persia game annoyingly called prince persia one also nice art style short however
really fun mini golf game lots interesting ideas levels id recommend think art looks good thats really youre buying got game free dont know id pay id pay sale price id like add game takes pretty high specs run suspect people complaining controls negative comments dont computers snuff think controls tight make point finished first course par
enjoyed nice controls good difficulty level pretty screens got things think might enough
guess fooled hype theres much different suppose hoping puzzles less timing jumping second harder campaign finish main may update review find better suspect timing jumping puzzles based two levels played far
like breakout type games feel like breakout clones lot modes options one nice art style feel lying bit since suggests breakout mixed rpg doesnt actually rpg mechanics
cant understand bad reviews everything want tacticle rpg game every combat unique experience often puzzles figure make things easier story interesting fun twists dialogue wellwritten particularly love static town screens dont talk every uninteresting twit make sure havent missed anything slight negative upgrade system rather complicated restart game figured
well written story combine interest mix puzzle rpg combatwhich depicts abstract struggles protagonists mind love negatives story especially first episode prologue isnt paced particularly well takes long protagonist walk across screen
lot fun given price point main thing seems trying remember button color controls feel bit like click create game free
really enjoy game id first heard fish fillets internet talking first game didnt grab many complicated rules moving carrying objects one wrong move would result instant death might mitigated generous save system many levels solution involved unintutive thing right beginning everything worked would naught game fixes everything never seen spectacular upgrade everything frustrating titles complicated positioning rules gone allowing concentrate solving puzzles rather carefully avoiding wrong moves somehow theyve managed make save system even better constantly autosaving every slight move make add host new characters fun rules clever bonus stars find english voice acting lets solve puzzles listening dialogue dont games let play listening cut scene pretty much perfect hard puzzle game best sort played two toki tori games plots cute
really like music art design levels feel like work puzzles thing getting complex never ahha moment would make seem like puzzles fair im half planets perhaps go back eventually feel differently change review
wish demos like puzzle game demos show easy puzzles beginning game gives sense hard puzzles game get shows puzzles featuring mechanics wide range difficulties even amazingly even includes secrets none puzzles exactly repeated game neither plot instead forms nice prologue story highly recommended even people already main game
ubisoft sure knows platformers fluid gameplay beautiful trailer screenshots would suggest issue due rather poor console port change key bindings controler pretty much required also im story platformer good story would unusual thing indeed
bug moves slowly across screenn keep left mouse button held entire time besides game finding hidden objects one puzzle requires thought last puzzle game good parts hand drawn backgrounds one puzzle end dont think outweigh annoyance controls
time spent watching animations slowly turn around
enjoyable roguelikealike enjoy desktop dungeons seems long run
pinball fx seems put one one wonderful table star wars packs case starfighter assault love x wings tie fighters fight right top pinball table shooter minigames lot fun darth vader seems one easiest tables entire library find get bored die return jedi fun enough like extra ramps flippers get added board unlock things
clone wars definitely running favorite table unlikely never seen cartoon dont care much prequels theres much table love extra training tables open missions fun empire strikes back less interesting fun play movie bobba fett way hard ball seems always always always go left outlane cant get anywhere
one favorite tables best attempt seen combing rpg pinball lot fun outfit knight level go fighting
much like king arthur theme one least interesting tables made extra modes overly difficult accomplish things ball seems drawn outlanes also idea joust mini game works hit launch button right time
although got game quite long time ago played restarted played appears start finish hours game disappointing point id beat final boss bought one extra balls monk wasnt even leveled enough able buy rest balls money think game easy unfortunate love ideas balls different one another different skills different physics unfortunate dont need use possibilities wish perhaps end set really fully thought tables pinball fx style could use upgraded balls still really recommend game see possibilities hope sequel expansion let fully explore ideas
absolutely wonderful game gorgeous landscapes broken enough puzzles keep interested id recommend anybody
well theyve managed make tedious boardgame
quite liked one reminds arcade games like boulder dash story basically level set maze told kill zombies bill puzzle game emphasis much avoiding zombies puzzle comes usually must kill zombies pick things proper order get bit repetitive eventually could see coming back playing levels hub little levels built quite unique also story progresses thing dont like thing experienced arcen games tried thats theres always lot filler rather lovely levels tons tons samey levels im sure lovely levels gotten tired end
got game probably worth price combination particularly new puzzles terribly unresolved plot overwhelm little enjoyment derived charming characters also hour playtime
theres good stuff interesting characters setting thanks novel based would say better film novel seen youtube slow hotel quite large soon character gets one end hes sent back also many puzzles tasks dont actually require puzzling would recommend youre interested strugatsky brothers stalkeraka roadside picnic inhabited island hard god anyone else
get uncut version adventure gamers instead steam tell people buy games censored
got game cents suppose shouldnt complain much puzzles never even get difficulty level get games magazine dell logic problem book yet sort adding problem inexpert port clearly iphone game viewing window far small especially linkapix annoying point drag rather normal methods say scrolling list intends swipe
plot delivery game really exceptional especially time makes feel like youre movie game platforming okay sometimes prince doesnt jump direction want problem platformers live combat wretched fight troops thats one battle fun
make sure controller game lot fun enjoyed sands time trilogy actually bit less cinematic ease fun experience lacked particularly got bogged endless streams enemies make sure controler one quick time events impossible mouse click left button fast possible least mouse wont pick individual clicks fast come pull options screen find binding action switch keyboard button quick time event switch back left mouse button incredibly annoying although played awful lot game much hour half steam says think one world away end game finally decided tedious continue
fun hidden object fun kinds puzzles mix things sort exists world rest frogware sherlock holmes games think ended watson wrote happened actually jack ripper case since wasnt allowed tell world turned lightweight game youre feeling burned
enough puzzles may well nonexistent click things obviously right order advance really anything plot direction either played better games kongregate
think nifflas makes best platfomers one exception become attached character worlds end wish hed make sequel one
thought fun short didnt even take hours steam says ate supper basically solve bunch simple puzzle safes without really anything story youd better sherlock holmes game maybe two levels difficult harder versions puzzles
unique solitaire game arrange cards poker suits set combos blast opponent fun story starts interesting setting things real history fantasy troops around quickly becomes kill bad guy dialogues tries tongueincheek often
seems like sort thing id like different robots different abilities working together solve puzzles short puzzles never become difficult also bit boring move robots problems lost vikings quite lively worth pointing sequel freeware game identical gameplay equivalent length would recommend playing first
one best games ever time low didnt play steam played gametap think free im sure suppose must part bundle really funny think game best implementation humor game ever seen plot interesting platforming fun perhaps bit long side get bored end milkman episode one many charming
dont know anyone needs review considering everyone already played fun lightweight puzzler wish puzzles become harder figure rather becoming harder execute game involves fair bit actionplatforming end
highly recommend game forerunner amnesia think interesting game like plot better location also interesting make sure get three acts end developers really figure everything right fun see progression get terrified great plot horrifying gameplay nice puzzles
good ideas short puzzles easy like im seeing something new kind would like see sequel actually takes idea makes real game think theres flash version demo play sites like kongregate
fun sokoban werewolf powers wish level gotten complicated end though
short youd better looking games kongregate
okay little logic puzzler better sudoku uses sort method
wonderful escape baums fantasy world really like takes place sequel books rather movie since really like puzzles rather easy side suppose want one playable kids adults really hope sequels short though probably lower price point
really like frogwares games general bit miss part sherlock holmes games fun really seem like exist world sherlock holmes story doesnt feel anything like dracula puzzles without exception things youve seen
wouldnt recommend someone didnt already like style game lot fun want something isnt taxing inventive majority hidden object games like two ways going things start right evil vampire vegitarian vampire
thought probably best first three games one would give positive review apparently puts odds rest gaming public thought well implemented liked physical puzzles pushing crates hanging ledges mild stealth gameplay suppose none usual series mixed rating puzzles others would hesitate call puzzles extremely convulted orders things advance plot plot none memorable
everything bad style adventure game one game mean even story bad georges girlfriend everytime hes away france seconds starts sleeping someone else rebuild relationship scratch current episode play gabriel knight games instead boygirl dynamic general kind mystery much better written
wonderful story presentation one fun action games played criticisms combat particularly intersting odd rhythm game fun first theres much end game eventually cant stand anymore also riddler puzzles fun also ultimately bit let never went intermediate hard difficulty really hoping metapuzzle would tie together never happened also could inventiveness boss fights say worht playing story atmosphere alone mention fun batstealth elements havent played next game yet hope sneaking less brawling
well everything seems fresh start almost immediately become rinse repeat pretty terrible game short repetitive also style humor game presents really sprung voice actors
somewhat hesitating recommendation much kind thing like exploring old ruins solving puzzles beautiful nice aural landscape suppose aspect dont like explore every inch thing tiny runes etched rock hidden areas must find gets boring end good maybe dont try play everything start blending together
completely unplayable puzzle color blind people besides short little substance puzzles plot
favorite x like different campaigns different play conquer neighbors game like either series worlds large world worlds attached possible though necessary places explore compete first finish series increasingly difficult quests maybe shouldnt default game mode expansion play single strong opponent appears middle civilization nagas time rather dremers first game like final mode encourages work together opponents whether computer players human players like computer allies really help something lacking really x games fight supremacy thing sets game appart focus tactical combat exploration rather civilization building roleplaying age wonders homm series like start right away army army grows much want build units time buildings cities bizarre restriction civ games endless games many different types neutral units hide great rewards spawn points much early game plain survival lot fun never seems like youve explored everything even hours spent warlock combined multiplayer turns turnbased rather simultaneous everything happens main map watch allies things dont seem boring homm would never play multiplayer really liking endless space endless legend well really lot discover pick play quality must play turns quality keeps playing even available suppose would play want something serious want something fun old standards civ homm really starting feel old standard current iterations
great best game got recent humble strategy bundle although less strategy game action puzzler
really love puzzle games rock paper shotgun went much liked one decided get first short finished game one sitting levels never get hard clever bit appealing still bit hypnotic mindless find much better puzzle games maybe buy copy games magazine
one solitaire game expecting collection one solitaire game simplified version golf played
absolutely magnificent
mix shooter rts bogged absolute worst pathfinding ever seen game pretty goes far
boring thing time constraint watch little bars load get money use upgrade things help alleviate time constraint youd better learning internet things work real someday might get real job rather fun one without getting paid real money
slow cant skip battle animations take hours get tutorial missions replay siege battle internet connection hiccuped booted uplay gave
one best puzzle games one actually hard puzzles
among worst adventure games ever played everything possible wrong done im glad though got sherlock holmes games together pack get much better bought one alone surely would avoided rest
miles better first sherlock holmes game second outing still good plots bit jumble items find far hidden theres also first person option game spent watching holmes walk slowly around large areas frogwares gets better though fact every game well worth playing even silly hound baskervilles
thought fun hidden object adventure nice takes place world larger frogware sherlock holmes adventure negative thing nonhidden object puzzles repeats larger adventures doesnt bring much new table
storyline pacing far best sherlock holmes game yet puzzles much easy side perfunctory however also lot repeated previous frogware titles one nice thing one incorporate frogware sherlock holmes plots plot though necessary played except perhaps awakened jack ripper arsene lupin heavily referred well though less important would highly recommend hope difficult puzzles future especially given skipping become option
kinda fun although suppose keyboard id probably sooner play chopins real music
wonderful enjoyment inventorybased adventure game years game beautiful story charming sad dialogue well translated puzzles mostly forgettable except maybe set fairyland im okay telling story time puzzle fit story theres rubber ducky get sewer key railroad tracks thing one review complains pixel hunting turn hot spots options generally wouldnt recommend wouldnt done oak leaf challenge beginning might give away one riddles
among best puzzle games played
would recommend game really fun mix city building late levels rts although difficulty curve bit gradual
challenging higher difficulties
mechanics enjoyable fan tactical puzzle games like breach unit variety great would like map varietycurrently battles either defend escort capture chests unique tiles different maps would nicefor instance breach levels dam train city buildings crystals tiles unique mechanics
crashes even version uninteresting diplomacy onemoreturn feeli havent motivated make age change
great simple graphics mechanics quibble dont enjoy realtime stupidlysimple minigames though accumulate unlock points unlock cheat make games easier really wish games could bypassed entirely since prefer playing entirely turnbased
fun unique mechanics great pixel graphics sound
great strategy still updated
quick minute games
looks promising feels intended quick play little micromanagement seems inspired polytopia hexarchy unfortunately frame rate loweven though graphics relatively simple straining radeon gpu slow x even though card new hopefully dev makes simpler graphics options

deckbuilder rpg unique mechanics storyline progression ui little daunting tutorials fairly quick explain enough get going wish text rendered clear legible font screens resolution
liked minimetro minimotors youll probably like unique game similar style bit micromanagey though get upgrades help streamline pathing youll need good peripheral vision
fun plenty strategy though times number special cards overwhelming particularly open booster decks orient new random temporary cards
short already beat plenty game price quick quite tactical took times get pack first level second level good specialized team built able beat every battle first turn managed finish game easily encountered bugs reviving character somehow managed get two duplicates character also restarting level dead somehow inventory became empty even though full previously couldnt pick items
roguish experience strategy depends alien artifact rewards unlock wish way power consumption goes limit would nice manually selectively disable certain power consuming buildings water etc little advanced strategy farlanders
really needs quick animation undo button also easily select multiple die great game liked one deck dungeon raceroll galaxy

challenging contemplative lots combinations strategies
nice fun cheap solitaire roguelike w spells

fun challenging roguelike citybuilder
unfortunately ai easy option increase difficulty even give handicap stuck playing online want challenge
lots different avenues win build deck based cards acquire smart ai similar agentplacement resourcemanagement dd lords waterdeep wish option much faster animations save time playing offline would nice overview deck eg ratio cards type played tile also would nice see cards acquired opponents already discard pile know possible cards could draw play
simple fast civilization focused card synergies
horribly unbalanced know get gold revenue flowing game becomes way easy boring
nice challenging higher difficulty levels great deck customization simple movement surprisingly provides quite bit tactical strategy different heroes provide unique methodologies would great future dlcs heroes wish undo button long dont end turn undo would actually fit time loop theme
bit breach tactical battles slaythespire progression
easy little challenge even hard price difficulty level logistics gamesending goods along snaking path though every station yields amount money short direct connection game ends mainly matter identifying making cheapest connections trying achieve combo chains essentially priorities delaying actually satisfying good demands make one final connection satisfies demands seems like counterintuitive way connect stations consequence combo mechanism graphics track layout engine fantastic however though one small gripe able put station already existing track
graphics beautiful great primarily care unfortunately means takes like seconds switch battle view overland view reason takes seconds market list populate reason ui worse basic things like trying compare players stats sometime like whenever see challenge map takes clicks first move mouse lower right corner click inventory see current players inventory move mouse little icon see info skills click compare button otherwise seems play like original primary gameplay difference x battle board doesnt seem terribly interesting far basically strategy either spread players enemy uses area attack effects otherwise keep players weaker defenses behind shield users otherwise least far gotten first chapter darkestdungeon style position manipulation dont think battle boards makes game significantly interesting original would preferred instead simply made new downloadable content using original games engineif aint broken dont fix
heretic operator vibes though events feel repetitive
favorite tactical espionage game clear simple isometric tilebased graphics makes much better games prioritize graphics gameplay plenty unlockable characters randomized levels makes plenty replayability
already experienced bug second level ui needs improvementsfor instance would nice able see view circular sector guards rather individually mouse individually instance preplanning movement nice feature unfortuantely hard tell far character able move per unit apthere dotteddash line somehow dots dont quite correspond increments apwould much clearer see concentric areas displayed floor showing far move much ap instead manually mouse around see figure personally feel like playing invisible inc meantime whose simpler graphics much clearer hopefully couple years give game another shot though
opening game fairly fastpaced later game unfortunately starts drag always spend gold draw cards stack even though card limit ends keep drawing cards economy good every turn end waste time buying food marketplace manually distributing cities could potentially increase population turn like x strategy games end exponential growth cities units means every subsequent turn drags much longer advertised hour complete final level weekly campaign challenge game good attempt trying streamline x civ game playing hours today think im done
simple enjoyable dimensional tactics enough variety actions combos
gameplay focused squad composition unit placement press start battle rest battle auto plenty repeatability matching different traits get different benefits unfortunately individual battle enemies maps events play though though unlock different maps would wish randomized enemies randomized battle maps true roguelike experience
fun turnbased rouguelike quick combat lots skills
breach mystery dungeon card battler
great music easy movement die manipulation fun quick dialogue
cute fun challenging lots different classes
fresh take tactical roguelike card battler use weapons floor pick
great visuals narration environment individual battles similar dd concept travelling oneway branching paths like slay spire fine deciding different partiallyscouted paths great dd removes lot fun dd instance maxing stress simply removes hp doesnt give interesting quirks swapping inandout characters levels balance recovering picking new tailored party next level rather playthrough party like rpgs rougelite whereby unlock abilities subsequent playthroughs different style game dd also unfortunately feel compelled drive stagecoach every little piece debris pick possible loot ends boring silly minigamemovement automated picking path
liked neo scavenger gives similar fresh experience simple graphics overhead view multiple party members great inventory management swapping items members car could made easier instance would nice craft using items car party members adjacent players dont spend lot game time swapping items around

enjoy challenge really punishing community builder random number generator strategy youll playing one dont get wrong type enough im pushing collect achievements much game thats counterintuitive fun gameplay unlock options go rather nice happens whether win lose event try influence winning course except options isnt necessarily good thing research options entirely randomized run map two linked example random vegetable might tomato gets bonus next water producer getting type water producer built stony terrain map little usable terrain optimized veggies wouldnt bad except theyre eating things one doom protection methods might also need despite unlocked many options access ones didnt get randomly rolled given playthrough oh things unlock way pretty much entirely negative unlock get positive ones beyond protect half bad events ones cant protect absolutely devastate village make increasingly unlikely impossible win ones influence think answer people workers dedicated defense well heres hoping also overcome increasingly punishing overpopulation penalty elders choose unique aspects prepared learn work around entirely new issues longer access ways might expecting solve problems normally believe higher difficulties might give points towards progression unlocking things honestly found reason inclined play anything higher easiest difficulty way amps punishment isnt worth minorly increased reward especially since wont take long unlock stuff unlocking stuff isnt usually good thing game lot potential great masterpiece genre took every choice along way detracts adding punishment rather options theres distinct difference challenging punishing missed along way catch sale bit masochist go update still largely dont agree many mechanics choices direction game cant deny developer clearly care vision future interact community youre okay harsher aspects youll probably get moneys worth even thing thats kept playing achievements doable challenging enough random number generator dependent cases take time effort get actually feel like little medals honour finally getting laughing loud
controls awful confusing theres much indication youre supposed
interesting concept things dont seem terribly well explained arent always intuitive said entirely feasible thats issue learning difficulties still enjoy despite struggle bonus managed get sale
fun game really enough especially gold beat challenges unlock card packs thats pretty much accomplish
everything love games like stardew valley harvest moon animal crossing elements focus gathering crafting rather farming love many characters personality stories outstanding theres lots little things id like see able explore abandoned buildings npcs bit expanded theres whose relationships seemnot worth effort involved raise places could impact maybe rewardconsequence things quickly vs slowly theyre things would icing already tasty cake
pros pretty game enjoyable concept cons execution stamina use everything places youve already traveled exploring map crafting etc wait recover stamina eat food except food craft stamina use find stamina use given oh eventually become well fed meaning cant consume anymore includes potions food carrying capacity seems exceptionally low maybe theres random trait increases means didnt find yet youre randomized save name appearance within small set options backstory get rerolls change starting gear traits didnt notice limited time creation mistake didnt feel terribly obvious looking stamina limitations max recovery low easy end increasing cost youre carrying heavy load carry capaicty relatively low easy hit simply dont feel like accomplished anything time im forced stop wait agree sentiments feels like browser game maybe pretty mobile game one id probably feel inclined steam game im uninstalling favour something feels rewarding time spent dropped stuff village storage leaving enjoy game feel free extra little boost however long actually good edit also recipes seem bugged raw fish raw potatoes show going cook correction placed village storage theyre craftable opposed everything else seemed crafted personal inventory though perhaps resource overlap village confusing deterring

couldnt get work game doesnt launch help forums month thats shame look like good game
one god awful games ever played poor graphics poor story telling doesnt got justice everything hamfisted disgusting extremely predictable like game thrones sometimes badguys win bit realisticbut game bad guys always win even lose want game thrones experience play rpg steam storyline player choices done right dont understand managed make borderlands game decent turn steaming pile like let c team interns writecode episodesstill way skip dialogue save money get tales borderlands instead
good old action rpg classic graphics ok time voice acting alright storyline ok etc bit mediocre worth bucks get nostalgic gameplay pretty lengthy well price tag
modest game made people purchased assets lighting good environmental graphics ok loved smoke able make wasnt scary enough atmosphere make didnt go overboard jumpscares anything story bit meh done decent fashion keep mystery happened puzzles doesnt really variety creatures end felt bit shabby honestbut overall decent game play recommend bucks stocking stuffer
combat game unit movement dumbest ever seen done dont understand something stupid gets implemented pretty much everyone goes good luck guessing going point bring win rather attempt use good tactics race ai terrible well literally attack like opportunistic bastards even entire motto peace literally told peace loving faction need learn value peace war provocation troops near small undefended town troops didmy mind blown idiocy justification war wasnt even sharing border worse part needed resource make diplomatic trades declarationsi literally couldnt kick someone territory influence point shortwhich absolutely retarded game lot potential falls short almost every aspect feels like half game built handful factions handful minor factions eras research top unreasonable lag seriouslythe game randomly lags random points never stops stutteringon nvidia thousand dollar machine happens every time literally give game second chance doesnt run smooth couple hours best dollar game paraded around idiots dont understand quality fascinated fantasy civilization cant recommend extremely frustrating play buy civ better
cant recommend minutes would totally recommend longer version game least hour long good game good aesthetics certainly worth bucks would continue developing even sequel
frustrating pile garbage best average stealth game worst terrible shoulder shooter cant recommend game unless big stealthisspy junky even dont spend bucks game starts pretty well stealth missions dumps tons nonsense go decent stealth missions poorly made missions timer enemies literally spawning afterwards turns awkward gun battles enemies use cover system dont access tell game overbudget rush finish job begins
dont bother game poorly optimized full hackers takes ya seconds google tool hack didnt even go hour finding people using
action game decent many things wrong cant recommend play literally feel like people made intended garbage constantly put situations die several times get lucky break im willing look past graphics ai etc idiot designed battles needs gtfo game design literally one part werewolves would stop spawning even shot bridge moved powerful versions spawned play enjoy extent game dump reason
mediocre game voice acting atrociously bad great graphics bit dated theme done well detraction game like fact game would kill certain situations made jot notes thats something normally adventure games refreshing sometimes strict order something sometimes need check try something twice seems led wander around bit sometimes trying obviousthen finding correct thingbut needed look something first bit pain story bit meh environment cyberish punk theme kept interested towards end game kinda felt rushed disappointed worth bucks grab get sale bucks
pretty solid open world rpg worth bucks id easily pay promising lot play time decent crafting character development system nice combat system graphics alright voice acting pretty good combat issues something find enjoyable im running warriormage hard mode far kept entertained complaint far user interface kinda crappy pain work blocking combat odd sometimes combat feels little sticky think thats player trouble blocking dodging incoming damage sometimes breaking sword swing isnt instant
game real pain get working terms multiplayer integrated steam gameplay kinda terrible like cheap top shooter cant recommend unless want spend hour port forwarding
poorly optimized cant run max settings using nvidia settings bit lower also give trouble havent able alt tab minimize either without go task manager crash game game looks decent cant recommend soley performance issues top line hardware edit cant even get classic missions work buggy game buy
fun game worth bucks recommend sale game self enjoyable play somewhat addictingbut felt lacking lot improvements could made realistic van space seriously everything takes space could also added bit store managementownership hot items aspect game rewards player playing badly example youll get dollar bonus buying hottest item category cause inexperienced players miss big ticket items even look one could miss picking dollar guitarbecause digging another category get bonus decent casual game id recommend younger kids people hidden object games
easily worth bucks maybe art design nice fully voice acted game mostly exploration combat mechanics get little stale story meh overrall exploration part game enjoyable indie game lot quality put little bit grinding involved like fast travel system built help recommend game sale cheap would good gift casual gamer
excellent game bit short easily worth bucks voice acting narrator great atmosphere visual style game nice well story bit meh horrible game decent puzzles might find getting stuck every often indie game delivers excellent quality id would definitely recommend anyone likes puzzleadventure games
average game story doesnt really get engaging towards end puzzles decent graphics meh atrocious voice acting done well makes lack polish game may main character seems bit touch reality cases would make good stocking stuffer anyone enjoys point click adventures
decent hidden object game bucks felt money well spent voice acting ok storyline somewhat interesting kinda felt urged continue play find objects puzzles storyline wasnt really motivating certainly triple title enjoyed puzzles digging around hidden objects like stocking stuffer people enjoy hidden object games would definitely recommend anyone modest expectations
easy abuse setups devs dont seem played game severely lack basic understanding people work led players severely abuse flaws designs wouldnt spend penny get higher levels even lower ones everything turns slime wall cannons narrow corridor thats full spring boards throwing back wall mines anyone bare minimal competence game design would avoided issue simply worth time investment barely enjoyment attacking castles
loved every moment laughing throughout entire lets play audio issues voice chat tolerable
pretty much basic hack slash spectacle fighter graphics decent age game basic lacks polishing depth aside couple bad puzzles lack luster boss fights game solid price decent considering indie game smaller team worst got good laughs minor problems game monsters die lot quickly god war dantes inferno etc really happy faster paced combat didnt spend minutes fighting trying kill things ok game bucks wouldnt pay though lacks polish recommend like genre want support indie developers ill buying lping expansion well
horrible game much missed potential performance horrible high end machines im lucky get frames per second normal settings one nvidia graphics poorly optimized good enough justify poor performance ai characters poor well character regularly walked circles trying get building right next game buggy unintuitive tooltips far many things recommend saving money game ton potential execution bad unless already know play plan looking guides stressful time getting
highly recommend graphics nice music soothing puzzles nice change pace puzzles seemed bit odd tedious overall enjoyed easily worth ill definitely look games
decent game bucks makes great stocking stuffer younger people found puzzles little bit easy voice acting graphics animations average storyline average well overrall average game worth killing hours time puzzles felt pretty unique except sudoko one hidden object scenes cool good throw back kids magazines find dentist office p alsoangelica one hell cleptomaniac
overall experience great first chapters note game spoils book tv series runs timeline tv series beginning game doesnt get ya real action starts story goerge martin involved ensuring intriguing usual graphics okthey kind wierd grow ya effect initial poor graphics start including glitches seem fade away environment done well heythey gots brothels combat terrible opinion youd spend half paused get anything done ai minimum ended giving hard mode switching easy mode running game beginner armor style points actually consider awesome starting gear best looking stuff game made pretty far without trouble difficulty spikes exception ruins experience run hodgepodge armor pieces varying types lot classes dont seem balanced properly judging complaints recommend playing watching great story even voices tv series decent amount moral choices make didnt feel overall game impacting fun non less dragon age genre level big fan series looking story lore recommend looking awesome indepth rpg probably isnt id happily pay bucks help get sequel market non fan biased view probably proper price
overall experience game great moral choices choices game bit difficult actually notice understand make choice couple story alright entirely easy follow end bit graphics cheap explosive effects cannisters sandstorms could used little polishing graphics fantastic paid decent amount minor details injuries bandaging game goes along guns decent variety mostly stuck starting weapons pistol amazing accuracy stopping power rifle little kickback controls pretty good dashingsprinting exceptions ie trying manuever around taking cover column tough also toggle mode sprint annoying hell holding letting go would much better ai ai decent points glaring issues oddities behaviour enough detract much gameplay guys wearing made absolutely sense desert ie super heavy suit armor difficulty played nd hardest mode felt mostly well balanced theres difficuly spike towards end found frustrating dont think game done justice first shoulder frames per second quite pleased

chocolate darkest alley downgrade comparing odyssey easiest worse combat worse movement fin slowmo forced combat even hard difficulty enemy ai one shoting fastest light attack cant even tell coming lmfao oh yeah first boss island somehow dont know stealthbackstab im sorry game called assasins creed right steer away years
frames per second k jank wasd movement sprinting kinda sprint forward also tac sprint exists reason every frames per second game none actually right constant motion blur cant get rid even sharpness cant spot far move footstep audio basically non existent smokes everywhere wallhack skills must cringe pretty mid battlefield overwatch skills game alright low performance worth
choose play beautiful slideshow advertised optimize graphics oblivion cope youre playing new improved ark looking forest glitching every light effect poking leaf pebble still getting x x performance better buying tasty kebabs
yes motherload clone yes paid full price would happily waste amount timemoney anytime playing cod ever takes hours want achievements
dont buy kbm player even costs terrible trust
cant believe found game decades havent played lot games smile face long og aimlabskovaaks thanks memories
performance fine ppl need learn configure games audio straight trash thats sitting months meaning footsteps anyone within directional shots whatever dont exist grenade spam needs chill fuck per person enough life getting shot descoping still thing decent frames per second past years mwno warzone even could improved would focus
games fine sure movement bit clunky sometimes die picto second even tho empty half mag enemy hated drone spotting say rd party spotting take rd party spotting like warzone simple first person spotting good love god add minimap thats always screen
trash game even worth playing free modernwarfare less hackers per minute garbage recoil place first time users makes even less enjoyable game vibrant full shadows headglitches wont see hear get shot im pretty sure didnt see setting make ads relative fov everytime ads zooms dont fov react people coming sides
hours max pain movement feels like coded buggy camera free aim also buggy story decent expected first headshots garbage hitreg getting shot dead guy almighty bullet dodge sideways boat falling death favourite likely one last shots take game go cinematic scripted bullet jump aim im even gon na bother trying finish game since last bug wont let go game recommend watch yt

played game like long time game great graphics good story great lore atmosphere narrative style campaign text book level genre plus game manliest game ever positive way feel epicenes lot scenes problem last boss design ai problematic high difficulty also attacks also game supports coop campaign operations pvp pretty decent matches easily find even though overpriced like games looking forward third game
simple short game offering great time puzzles game mostly feels like chapter however price game decent especially sales game offers point system puzzles high scores hard achieve new system fresh playstyle enjoy
last game series enjoyable short game even though graphics better bit different games puzzles like chill game puzzles designed differently finishing games wanted play side however care time since side obvious seen side also ending bit lacklustre wasnt enough end series still good game original unique content worth experiencing
enjoyable game family friends game played child relaxed experience play friends get stars everything get stressed unexpectedly gameplay length pretty good however controllers compatible game still two players play one controller two play keyboard plus use remote play means one person needs purchase
surprisingly fun game course played friend
high hopes game however total bust couple choices matters throughout game story make sense main character treats half like game forces make choices characters including main character black guy seems decent enough screen time romance options feel forced sadly especially agent one game forces play chapter go date nowhere also biggest grooming gaming history reason okay game relations game couple days indian guy even one moment intimacy similar homeless people spend time trust everything main character says men leave burning building without hesitation friends baby building way even know powers game full kinds idiotic moments definitely worth time
purchase prime able play ranked weirdly valve claims help hacker hackers ranked reason guess ranked full hackers valve taking money game free reason game one highest cheater ratio developers care weirdly gift prime status gambling part aimed children used money laundering years ago valve games meant something different right greedy also lots alternatives kinds shooters one valorant free
would recommend game full price great discount value sales review discounted price roguelite game pretty simple honestly bit repetitive however selling items shop great idea makes game much enjoyable would expect upgrades features store isnt much still shop aspect decent important part game art style simple aesthetics suits well games atmosphere isnt much story npcs would expect much roguelite important part roguelite would gameplay play style items upgrades bit straight forward pretty simple bit clunky time therefore great bad game questionable choices like bosses killed armors gives speed give much speed instead higher armor rating useless weapons types etc reasons think great game discounted price mediocre game full price
contrary base game downloadable content feels hollow enemies base game much higher hp lot hp sadly damage new enemies mostly annoying item steal abilities mace wielders annoying attack pattern game becomes much bigger repetitive task main game annoying rare items upgrades useless special weapons expensive different currency resets every time leave dungeon elevator system reason developers thought adding old cheap items good idea forces constantly arrange inventory reason upgrade shop weird since main theme game also new system limited item trade rare items purchased way haggle another grindy aspect sadly downloadable content repetitive grindy experience wasnt able enjoy
games series enjoyable game however much better puzzle designs still puzzles great original playing game side feels great
normally despise borderlands games story annoying cringing writing dialogues repetitive gameplay however game great writing character development soundtrack wellmatched world tiny references games borderlands even though illusions choices like telltale games choices impact story also would recommend buying sales since great discount rate
even though wasnt great release game enjoyable friends moment wasnt fan singleplayer especially achievements singleplayer since luck important multiplayer decent choice couple rounds time time weirdly one song game bother also game affordable price kind game another positive thing
even though big fan district system game pretty enjoyable relaxing experience time see art style great simple balancing issues need content game still early access still enjoyable state
like first game great game enjoy friend puzzle designs fantastic watching someone play makes think puzzles pretty easy see perfect design kind game play game even though short requires two games play one one friend satisfy hunger puzzles recommend playing sides purchasing sales since great value

one games inbetween think reason recommend game decent price game developers courage try something new even though old formula perfect positive graphics soundtrack atmosphere great building mechanics different bad except finding certain buildings lots new mechanics laws technologies explore plus game another challenge survive negative new mechanics change feeling game sadly first game battle life death making feel responsible people care political aspect game makes annoyed brink extinction whats protest vital place pass law send faction favours grant law want factions want law pretty much tied contrary first game events pretty similar sandbox arent much unique encounters see map exploration boring isnt anything exciting improving lore
see easily great art style terrific atmosphere game tells grief symbolism great job however isnt much gameplay aspect game pretty short still would recommend game especially sales since great price
even though graphics nice atmosphere relaxing decent soundtrack game feels bit dull needs lot micro management production chain sadly set number produce limit according stocks similar situation people lose working people equipment easy keep track color palette buildings similar also raids feel tiresome sometimes attacked constantly levelled distance means get raided strong enemy near base get economy going really goes without much makes boring around midgame lastly relations factions bit weak since anything trade sum think game might potential long road right expensive
pretty enjoyable game especially friends weirdly supports people much coop games invitation system steam broken join game hosts name although graphics old animations funny least gameplay simple game enjoyable relaxing experience bit stressful beginning since clear direction find things trying like using numpad placement controls another enjoyable part broom mechanic plus game gets updates surprise since free definitely recommend game
bit review even though gameplay features decent world deus ex interesting comparing one human revolution think game sufficient good one first feels rushed arent decent choices end story seems like halfdone dlcs dlcs irrelevant lackluster good missions still enough since main missions exciting part characters writing bad obviously finished feel bit frustrated end reason ending scene first part credits skippable normally would problem credits almost minutes long replay ending skip bug makes game crash trying exit gun range however simple bug easily fixed developers unfortunately care also long time one huge problem shows developers care enough another problem micro transactions single player game okay especially breach player friendly system obviously intentional reason added downloadable content gives items great downloadable content least free triangles find scan barcode receive something extra one worst ideas ever heard however use problem part lastly game includes downloadable content named breach makes go vr mode hacking sadly pretty boring repetitive isnt much story files recovered however pretty boring genius thought waiting messages good idea buying everything via box system another annoying feature dlcs purchase guns directly purchase box open yes system singleplayer game conclusion game potential sadly isnt planned executed well enough always shadow human revolution least decent price sales
worth especially full price even though new area gameplay time pretty short much new features downloadable content worth money story game pretty irrelevant main game reason go prison prisoner reach agent visitor guardian much guess paper second part interesting really different gameplaywise probably reason length downloadable content sadly need dlcs achievements

another game enjoyable play friends great atmosphere planets discovering first time really great however game bit repetitive main occupation resource gathering maybe automating guess part pretty boring sadly also lot bugs controls great especially flatting terrain definitely would play game solo said enjoyable friends also developers added lot free content missions new items think implemented well great mechanics aliens another negative point option base building games think system aims practical much design appearance plus people server great option modern games would matter crowded party lastly would recommend purchasing game sales since great price sales
game weird design fun friends easily merrier however finding right seed important pricewise could much pay full price though

decent free game although cosmetics expensive good choice play except huge learning curve optional expenses
game similar total war game rts aspects isnt good enough play rts aspect game makes game special however repetitive need micro manage towns get ahead battles lose units conditions units requirements playthrough gets tiresome plus point almost countries declare war since peace treaty chain chain reaction war declaration send armies around world think things understand isnt much time thing micro managing towns armies technology progress bit slow constant battle diverse enough isnt many units pikeman x swordsman x archer x cavalry x militia x siege units units course graphically isnt great least wasnt bug sum find game pretty repetitive boring price wouldnt lose something try try game released year different title thing released year later
much say interactive movie obviously pretty short bit disappointing choices dont matter story pretty bad even fmv doctor becomes hacker hacking super easy everyone agent opening vents microscopes toilets without pipes etc dialogues try something mostly fails half delivered jokes characters acting weird storys low quality plus acting bad part note spelling errors like english subtitles guess interactive movie rushed definite
game one best games ever played may seem like childish game setting main events certain grimness behind nave world check negative reviews part even though frame story isnt spectacular enjoyable dialogues story elements make fine unexpectedly game great songs songs great harmony levels wellmade part game level design none levels mechanics tiny platforming mechanic every level offers different experience different different characters finish game twice without getting bored plus game length isnt short sure took us finish sadly game requires origin account least one person play remote play problem friends pass system play one purchased game problem game able fix obviously definitely recommend game everyone maybe people want play children

even though game isnt bad isnt good either firstly wasnt content released game added content free update selling dlcs since paradox interactive publisher lot downloadable content milk customers dlcs required achievements idea space city building great sadly isnt much game arent many buildings activities aim motive play developers designed game drone workforce since workforce work colonists cant set specific number stop child instead choose colony colony feel like burden positive parts see graphics pretty good looking game great ost even though pretty basic try partial story implementation map choices modifiers challenges skins cant say encountered bugs game fun couple hours became bit dull still mediocre game bad game gave thumbs content release style
game great first released reason play nostalgia guess every part game feels bad comparing modern shooters story shows much progress made add expensiveness years old game equation purchase game makes nonsense
free stuff came downloadable content great course included released game still good addition guess pay downloadable content get two new countries competition competition part pretty much useless trade offers bad like electronics food learn technologies teach basic ones complex ones sabotage steal dont know would compete achieve points slow forget leaves bad events probability tend sabotage even relationship good new countries japan brazil different aspect sponsors however already many sponsors choose wouldnt care sadly need downloadable content getting achievements
terraforming mars earth sounds good sadly isnt first downloadable content included main game case isnt like every paradox interactive game pass charging extra regular content part reason terraform mars game terraforming provides tiny advantages like vaporizer production increase meteor showers soil quality increase could useful climate change water atmosphere presence terraforming easy take much time especially terraforming part planetary mission increase terraforming need wait sols able means researches huge colony finished wont need advantages plus none colonies try help task open domes terraforming use less oxygen neither colonists animals go outside domes unfortunately need downloadable content achievement completion
downloadable content consists animals domes zoom cosmetic ranches vegan quirk research improve specialized colonist advantage compatibility terraforming animals cant go outside food output difference ranches useless reasons reason buy asking money something like downloadable content sad
downloadable content contains buildings supposed part main game even downloadable content isnt enough buildings implementations good enough
normally hate dlcs like downloadable content lot great songs especially elevate worth
music good downloadable content consist skins cosmetics totally worthless
game one games make think old even though positive aspects lot bad design choices first color palette limited enemies color attack action colors similar mean means fight group enemies problem see visual clues rely audio time story generic doesnt really say anything says something mostly discrete tiny piece huge amount cutscenes length becomes annoying focus bayonettas sexiness cheesiness feels decent first becomes another repetitive element gameplay balance pretty prologue hardest mode regular difficulty bit hard adjust hardest part game except halfforced camera toughest enemy especially flying enemies problem applies challenges challenges new player second playthrough lot challenges first chapters harder late part game balance problem learning game almost explanation option practice thought putting practice part loading screen makes impossible try something modern pc good idea option game one worst menus ever seen like equipping weapons leaving menu thats probably port though save system probably hard time understanding like lot people lose save leave game first time even second playthrough design problems tiger mode disabled cause die use acquiring second playthrough unfortunately controls combat arent great played game keyboard mouse felt unresponsive controls add bad counterwitch time system lot problems unresponsive controls even though lot weapons quick use two weapon slots need change combination menu want change another weapon one set furthermore torture climax attacks really torture since using animation midcombat doesnt make sense avoid using attacks far sadly attacks forced boss fights fortunately arent many boss fights moreover enemies instantly attack spawn knock cutscene including torture attack animations plus annoying quicktime events kill instantly expected reaction time pretty narrow quicktime events occur cutscenes bugged talking epilogue one lastly halo currency system slow progress sum game definitely doesnt worth time
comparing base game one much harder difficulty long many conversations downloadable content people talk lot since loved main game loved downloadable content sadly answer last question wasnt satisfying required guess unlike answers downloadable content good meta fiction cliff hanger ending two parts system cant say much without spoilers plus free whats like
game one original games ever played easily say masterpiece great way practice english listening skills game try solve mysteries listening however hearing problem problem focusing listening without anything game wont fun miss dialogues story make sense even though cant tell much without spoiling say enjoyed listening maestros logic narrative framework balanced difficulty selfreferences relations coincidences negative aspect game obviousness accents understandable developers point view definitely recommend game
game pretty fun original content much say actually metafictional antigame type short game puzzles solve complete game nothing negative game definitely recommend
game similar style ufoxcom series spy setting sadly isnt great combination least game game lot different features looks like lot features useless game feels really repetitive long playtime finish supposedly different stories repetitiveness becomes much worse story one blandest ever seen like mixture spy thriller common themes nothing mean nothing specific member cia kgb mossad extended mode offers one hour different content developers advertise like different experience cases read narrative guess however developers decided split couple ambiguous cases censor words reuse player needs solve case narrative reward rinse repeat unfortunately isnt many cases compensate developers decided use cases different names arent many cases plus leaving cases beneficial please stop real story cliche sell weirdly animations turn options first hours cosmetic variety could added decent camera enemy turn show important things good explanation technology unlock didnt care parts gameplay main missions established missions content random means see enemy agent great health bar like especially problem hard beginning game another random thing leveling choose different skills leveling lot skills useless even though game turn based enemy sees turn enemies turn hostile know agents even dont see magically learn position choose go guns blazing infiltrate real reason go aggressive enemy get neverending reinforcements another problem design choices cant hide bodies hard magically disappear easy bad pathing option choose route move killing civilians causing penalties exploding building stationed impact contrary teaching skills weapons biological improvement option teach languages weirdest enemies dont react jump closed windows damage course fact routes regular ones reasons mentioned gameplay feels like chore also bugs like random alarm turn pretty regular one huge annoyance inconsistent soldier awareness bar missing evac loading game sum avoid game isnt worth
game pretty interesting gets bit monotonous similarly prison architect enjoyed first hours lot learning basics starting understand game mechanics doesnt take long game gets bit dull addition game doesnt explain things like employees happy working longer hours items usage specialty products sadly isnt duplicate option copy building manually nothing want expand without design tool annoying still art styles cuteness original building game modes price make shortfalls
even though game classic didnt age well cant say pathing difficulty curve beginning chapters hard waiting lack information buildings limited ranges feel good campaign challenge two different scenarios mission however feels bit repetitive especially trying peaceful playthrough plus campaign old game length pretty long honestly game one best time nowadays good nostalgia modes make game much better sadly like play vanilla cant comment lastly think good game todays standards price range words dont expect much going try
weird see max payne game without noir setting even though lots inner monologues like prequels game feels bit colourful soundmusic design different isnt femme fatale could weird though dont think game max payne game great game even predictability problems game meaningless scenes like serrano forgiven lifting giovanna max easily could reach place graphics look pretty decent except long hair gun variety feeling good game length satisfying music especially healths tears great general writing dialogues narrative aspects well made although highlighting texts cutscenes seems bit childish lot unskippable cutscenes hate going achievements max payne game great probably different however say good closure sadly lots crashes bugs especially multiplayer dead achievements really grindy level multiplayer grinds completing game times repetitive crashes make one almost impossible least doable mode recommend complete mode competionist base especially huge sale price

even though game masterpiece first made version feels like mobile game lots bugs bad ai unfortunately developers didnt bother fix old bugs instead added bugs game even population cap campaign tiny army find new ways stuck ignore orders sometimes wont follow target even pass worst pathing enemy ai using map hack repetitive unbalanced missions add lack things like gates garrisons negative aspects mention random priest conversion time waiting overly aggressive ai opponent spent resources im disappointed game
begin game gray area reading developers comments developing process dlcs decided make review positive game adds bombs destroy mountain portals mines mounts couple changes mechanics new units upgrades importantly coop however additions new lands arent enough someone played kingdom games coop isnt challenging different kind approach reasons developers added two free dlcs one japanese texture pack changes pikeman ninjas different mechanic one new mounts riders cast spell texture pack even dlcs game doesnt feel different new lands since expensive offers coop may want try

first game mostly interactive movie isnt much gamewise mostly wonder around tasks tasks pretty simple tasks difficult thing taskspuzzles lack instruction objective marker need listen carefully focus playing get lost one first tasks dont even say key press bright side lack instructions realism since game feels like movie avoided weird adventure like puzzles persistent realism aspect understand strongest aspect observation cinematography graphics point view stagesetting scenery sound voice acting pretty good however thats bit long movie unfortunately mystery starts fade couple hours story feels like mediocre one sadly games slow tempo stretched playtime bland writing make decent game

game oldschool adventure game visual novel unfortunately doesnt affect gameplay well isnt exactly adventure game isnt real puzzle exactly visual novel means dont expect dull still advantages good gameplay aspects like travel scenes nonlinear narrative characters timeline variety protagonists soundtracks exceptional plus narrator voiceovers pretty good weirdly delay lipsynch scenes even though game intriguing first became dull especially last book problem story consisting many plots using many revelations story especially book three resolve everything quickly moreover became preachy story progress particularly last part many unrealistic rushed things game summarise black merchant century one mentions black meg banu musa really feels like joke quick understanding new things really childish forgetting made consequence even though richard says wont countess countess next scene even missable achievement becoming countess search jack part gave tremendously sour taste perfect english everyone even foreign lands still game isnt bad game mediocre
expansion adds two new factions game panzer elite british forces british forces defensive faction useless armoured units panzer elite depends heavy armour mobile units addition factions campaigns caen operation market garden long main campaign total even though missions bit similar lot defence missions still offers variety lots new units portraying panzer elite evil another plus course highly recommended buy bundle play base game without installing expansions
expansion consists three short campaigns tiger ace causeway falaise pocket guess controlling tiger tiger ace campaign weirdly biggest threat tiger grenade rifles friendly ai pretty bad causeway play small part american paratroopers missions campaign lot fun british campaign maybe feel much stronger falaise pocket trying defend wehrmacht time campaign offers original playstyle defence missions except falaise pocket units campaigns limited strong campaigns add new skills like direct attack hide revive plus command points consecutive feel like impactful one differs playstyle unfortunately one one new map dlcs campaigns different style cutscenes isnt bad highly recommended buy bundle play base game without installing expansions
game one classic rts games base game american campaign game compensates shortfall expansions campaign doesnt feel like biased story reminds saving private ryan map variety campaign pretty good especially think original release date quest variety decent point system advantage units positions original features back original release date although features bit old shouldnt real problem however ai isnt good cheats sometimes still big issue problem game performance stabilised one modern systems unfortunately saving game loading screens take minutes reason ssd mk havent played game like rts definitely try especially expansions
game could telltale game choices matter game similar first batman game one choices change character joker last episode scenes characters even though isnt sequel playing branching story definitely enjoyable like prequel game rewrites batman story grimmer sense tries make decent characters antagonists tries couple antagonist game isnt long liked first one probably like one downside game clich actions scenes unfortunately couple game big deal certainly game one good telltale games

sequel continues first games story play different horseman death however time fetch quests bounty quests every character see mocks death give something since know story first game learn death backstory isnt much probably go dungeons solve puzzles platforms without caring story downloadable content campaigns give short dungeons enemies blue variety platforming puzzle aspect game overused reason part feels like chore game bit like open world game side quests although isnt much open world side quest mostly collection quests quests annoying even guide checklist game new game option finishing game dont know someone would like first playthrough pretty soulless repetitive already combat though important part game right unfortunately arent many combos moves combat repetitive isnt much variety enemies except paint jobs different enemies sadly boss fights dont compensate reaper form feels pretty weak battles camera angles bad viewpoints morever locking big enemy doesnt help couple skills level much gear drop gear find useless since money mostly useless selling wouldnt useful either way explanation stats weapons specials good luck figuring lastly bugs game huge bugfest encountered every kind crash visual audio unresponsive game puzzles let summarize quickly game crash sometimes nothing graphics looks pixelated modern systems audio partially disappear play change additional campaigns sometimes character wont move press escape forced restart game additional campaigns broken puzzles may require restart need work around solve understand game mess half finished basically another game isnt worth time spent unless huge fan genre series
bought downloadable content batman shadows edition discount shadow dlcs free thats gave positive review personally think free dlcs big want check story use mode play game noir visual style isnt anything
first big fan batman actually batman annoys bought game telltale game expectation series surprisingly pretty good story wasnt bad mafia connection shining moral compass give story depth enjoyed gotham batman productions contrary blackwhite aspect movies games universe motive behind crime makes atmosphere darker choices bigger games developer although still pretty linear even though voice acting feels bit weird first different mainstream get used gameplay bit different regular telltale games lots quick time events basic detective work talking even bruce wayne isnt boring game
game isnt bad game good game either adventure game mostly depends story however story pretty dull mixture sciencefiction themes without depth also nothing original game aspect choices sake moreover almost gameplay couple mini games play although music variety game pretty good even though exactly integrated game playing manually art style pretty decent horrible game plain
even though like tv show really liked game bit distant person literal know person sherlock better doctor watson etc smugness sherlock definitely prefer game version sherlock holmes tv show one still game characterises watson like imbecile yesman dont enjoy although watson ironic line game dont right take life stories game mostly satisfying except two cases cases sauna garden dont make sense none cases solved based real evidences time use circumstantial evidences arrest someone maybe could led real evidence moreover game offers chance make wrong choice continue plus moral choices even though related narrative every victim thanks game mechanics easily choose another option case change decision replay chapter interface different aspect easy use detailed detective game game deduction mode gives option analyse suspect pretty original detailed face character modelling offers fun experience add loading screens game pretty modern interesting first least interesting part game unique design lots different scenesplaces repetitive dont feel like copypaste thing applies mini gamespuzzles lots different kind puzzles different mechanics aspects game cinematography game great point views events quicktime events character changes aspects wellthought
good addition base game since game oriented towards late gameexperienced players zubmarine routes buying downloadable content makes sense downloadable content adds new places stories enemies new ambition new mechanics like current sonar mines loots abysses even though new ports doesnt content base game course although new content interesting awfully short independent one small connection moreover problems base game consist tedious gameplay slow progression consequence reward still liked sunless sea probably like downloadable content

decent addition base game new planets weapons skills mission variety hero pretty useless harder levels whole new corruption mechanic campaign plus supply system branched couple areas also new narrative elements like choosing talk people unlockable entry optional corruption quests however weird reason cant skip cutscenes campaign forced watch even repeat mission game old problems different endings couple different lines obnoxious font levelling screen multiplayer last stand chaos race multiplayer two new heroes last stand dont expect much downloadable content satisfied purchase
even though game cuts rts features campaign decent however annoying things like unknown enemies cant learn strengths vulnerabilities campaign defence missions overwhelm time consuming meaningless repetitive finishing animations unbalanced difficulty unresponsive controls unit movement reason mechanical visual bugs misinformation even item immunity knock back knocked back time limited missions dont correct time limit worst rain animation seen repetitive achievements achievements chaos invasion cant percent without chaos invasion buy chaos invasion forced achievements chaos invasion multiplayer last stand options already dead one play even snipe multiplayer take forever find game

story really illogical game isnt real bioshock game think one ending nothing morality game cant take two guns powers like plasmids useful sky line mechanic funny however think game different frames per second original series think rpg elements probably like frames per second game welldesigned way game one best ost circle unbroken cover still like frames per second games looking sequel game dont mind frames per second quality story love game looking strong story bioshock spirit hate
normally like stealthy games enjoyed second part especially first part plus story much better first part little events rapture however last part doesnt make sense say strong security would able pass sent isnt anything opinion best part infinite think enjoy feel shooty
story ending really bad game isnt bad much harder originial game like two shots mode autosave problem first part rapture beginning welldesigned adds details bioshocks originial world
cant choose wave want lots bugs including sky hook enemies sometimes elizabeth game crash progress progress lost manual save wave one kill enemies ribbons really annoying often one falls killed another enemy however different voxophones game maybe buying bundle sale good idea
selling single player coins skins downloadable content suprising guess got bundle doesnt make difference
buy bundle

bioshock one favorite games love story idea behind great elements cant suggest remastered versions anyone amd issue game cant load textures save bug sometimes way buggier originial version prefer first game second story depth characters still great game making player big daddy pretty good idea play book appreciate game go play original one
one best frames per second games time still great graphics story like action movie combat system pretty fun helicopters acting weird times like looking invisible problems game
timeless rpg classic even someone like like star wars game doesnt really advanced system sufficent random events companions well designed neither hard easy except infinite enemy part part annoying story guess would accurate say game similiar narrative star wars wellwritten cant say bad either
great game lots endings criticizing play style game encourages try different things even coding playing game narrators voice acting pretty good wonderful idea accompany
pretty good puzzle game original play style one puzzles annoyingly hard bit buggy amd driver nothing important definitely worth price

liked open lower level adventure first game still good buffing party every fight fun required higher levels
pretty good story annoying characters bad combat would better infinity engine game
nice tactical shooter varied interesting levels controlling three squads intuitive cool friendly ai dumb rocks enemy ai inconsistently unfairly accurate almost ruins game quick saving loading helps lot
downloadable content best dark souls youll find whole series harder first game
prefer two max payne games lot visual effects everywhere make game much worse still worth playing
game suffers huge drop quality final two missions terrible experience find hard recommend rest game pretty good though
major negative story characters lame everything comes across incredibly campy fun game otherwise every mission unique noticeably bad one
pretty great game gameplay basically android james bond minus cars sneak around hack computers doors use gadgets shoot people blow story never comes close original deus ex still interesting characters unlikable fashion hideous
good call duty earlier medal honor games still good tactics basic ai bit stupid times story little directionless worth
game takes hours finish hardest difficulty theres build variety ng la dark souls theres reason play good single play would recommend using origins subscription service play instead paying

subpar knock gta except tedious clunky worse shooting also worst port video game history worse original watch dogs almost unplayable without controller asks use shift tab navigate pause menu keep forgetting try using wsad mouse nothing happens know games would let game runs okay machine fact struggles reach frames per second times stupid game years old must play game nostalgia get preowned console copy however nostalgia game loved game high school apart amount customization available little else going game like san andreas forced side missions progress storyline artifical way pad run time game basicly theres mechanic called respect able progress story must side activies missions fill meter bad news people like leave side activities theyve completed story think kinda total game time purely main missions itll probably hours long really tried playthrough game couldnt bring would recommend people like open world games character creator even community mods

good game improvements sieve apart art design forever tarnished attempt trying sneak spyware game files
almost great game really shows limitations source engine common sourcemod bugs weapon stutters crashes level design isnt great genre either tries resistance liberation comes many gamebreaking exploits
like point based real time strategy micro management would recommend game however someone likes base building resource gathering production found game rather boring
puzzles back backtracking back running hallways filled monsters whilst trying conserve ammo back cheesy voice lines back resident evil back baby shame made chris look weird guise photogammetry though downloadable content includes everything shouldve main game extra cost

id say best frames per second shooter first cs influenced lot frames per second games old outdated though still great
game good value buy
simply best coop game ever made insanely replayable even two players
disappointing still fun somehow puzzles dont make logical sense like shotgun puzzle instance way could solve using lever glitching shotgun wall respawning get red key even youtube could save one game play really janky rage inducing time like art style creepy neighbor thats real redeeming quality genuinely think youre better playing alphas maybe playing hello neighbor instead much preferred id recommend picking youre already fan hello neighbor game painful times also makes easy completion youre interested wouldnt recommend youve never played though unless think youre mentally capable
best game ever made hands playing years wont stop
really fun burnt base got killed horse got zapped lightning seriously game really good
game feels like resident evil bedroom mini game entire game really fun similar granny well little unique looking forward seeing games dev
game goofy doesnt even feel real play feels like goofy dream goofy game doesnt exist
last neighbor game avoid black schizophrenic man kitchen knife house youre burgling mothers chemo therapy treaments really mildly amusing finished roughly mins
fun game quite bugs seems standard simulator type games original game isnt much different theyve added stuff like stealing parcel lockers even heists nice edition id love see another thief simulator game hopefully theres upgrade game improved slightly feels like downloadable content almost price solo developer theres much complain
grannys little freaky sheets cause found grandpa locked basement straight jacket needless say enough reason continue playing game
great game great concept abhorrent performance cool underlying story think itd great see fully fledged game multiple set pieces films arent cabins proper story new game possibly update something would awesome gripe performance bad lowest settings rtx get frames per second shocking
good stealth isnt great solo play needs work ai needs commands something similar crime boss would good
better payday
double nothing mode makes severely depressed love gambling
jawn ridiculously easy gotten every ending possible hours also game step first still fun horrendous map design though
game really fun already beaten twice first hours game play multiple endings good game could scarier really isnt many ways avoid enemies jump scares score underwhelming literally one track enemy loops infinitely lost killed combined doesnt give scary game gives game avoid someone graphics fine think feeds aesthetic wouldve liked lore game instead different cut scenes different escape also explanation granny said side characters like spider granny slendrina dev decides make another granny game think take consideration genuinely lot potential everyone knows goofy granny mobile horror game edit hour later completed everything game offer
kinda got gist game quickly dont care play feels like fetch quests game
unironically boring asf
love game great atmosphere charm youd hard struck finding nowadays story characters keep engaged humour game nice addition doesnt entirely take self serious good thing also perfect balance entirely goofy im going lie game couldve improvements regarding survivor ai combat survivor ai really big pain essentially need keep calling order follow time theyre completely incapable protecting meaning isnt really rare occurrence die combat really bad todays standards block incoming attacks leaving completely vulnerable order shoot gun aim sights making stand still free fire without accuracy almost abysmal tips new players like immediately leaving security room upon entering warehouse find mannequins throw pick torso one hits zombies refill camera batteries cams camera located paradise plaza quick traversal go sportrance skate board located paradise plaza pm day get rifles shotguns huntin shack north plaza find books throughout entire mall give certain buffs stats game probably one best zombie games favourite one recommend enough youre zombies
like thief simulator game genuinely sucks buy far played blatantly obvious bugs obviously havent spent time fix sound design absolutely horrible look past maybe youll like genuinely bored playing unfortunately bought cd key cant refund either
fan first game played feels like downloadable content sequel would liked see mechanics added maybe hide identity maybe way counter police arriving like keeping people gun point prop gun something similar something buy time maybe harsher consequences getting caught dont feel punished reload checkpoint lose anything without repercussions variety locations houses maybe banks jewellery stores supermarkets etc also new drone phone buddy feel like gimmicks guess well see full release hope game exceeds expectations full release moment cant help feel slightly disappointed find leaning towards original game
okay gameplay felt slightly better predecessor many gimmicks added unnessacary addition new weapons made annoying instead better doesnt always mean better case think worsened game think enjoy game think story wasnt good game came end game getting tedious game isnt bad sadly gameplay redeeming quality opinion
predictable lot bugs really bad transitions cutscenes game play good think game kinda plays though push games many flaws lot fun edit cant finish game game breaking bug edit complete game breaking game playing intended goty
personal opinion better shadow chernobyl factions system cool reckon ill definitely find playing every faction eventually people say story isnt good shadow chernobyl id agree wasnt really invested story start dont really find engaging entire reason love games atmosphere feeling completely rare see video game map essentially exact shadow chernobyl really hate swamp area pain traverse think game great little underappreciated compared shadow chernobyl call pripyat definitely recommend picking entire trilogy get sale humble bundle roughly think
people never played crysis game id play remastered versions people played isnt worth purchase basically visual improvement opinion feels like cranked saturation added ray tracing delete frames per second called day perfectly fine game worth replaying even called graphical enhancements
game great love regret getting earlier feel like slightly overrated time masterpiece pick havent already really difficult fun
id really like enjoy game bad unoriginal exactly like indie survival games really janky clipping texture issues poorest performance ever seen exact frames per second rx xt crowded area zombies normal settings dont recommend game shouldnt even price tag free id consider playing price buy something way better thing game going art style
bad good boring occasional hordes zombies pain considering bad combat jump scares blue made flinch little story okay atmosphere creepy dont really recommend game though game play good story atmosphere redeeming quality
perfect wouldnt say better predecessor fun first games map way better remember advertising bigger better mentality first games map million times better memorable land marks instead sea trees greenery well smaller requiring walk time argue theres transport map built mind feels like mistake doesnt work building next gripe immersive way creatively limiting theres things could build first game wouldnt possible plus fact takes way longer build fatiguing id give game imperfect flawed key aspects still blast play
completing game say chernobylite really story rich linear sandbox survival game shoes scientist named igor searching wife tanya post apocalyptic chernobyl playing game look clues surrounding long lost wife see visions clues allow run simulations past events cool idea simply dialogue wish wouldve interactive scavenge supplies base companions weapon upgrades every decision made affect companions game play ending game alter decisions later visiting memory timeline happen mess really nice feature nar main enemy throughout game also happen cause apocalypse addition apocalypse shadows found wild shadows dont really pose much threat easy enough handle game offers stealth take enemies isnt really best sandwiched two guards hidden bush multiple times crouching hiding bushes extent stealth system game unfortunately levelling easy enough level completing quests killing enemies upgrading weapons upgrading base gathering materials roaming around theres almost always side quests also another way levelling character level gives skill point companion skill tree companions sent scavenge quests companions unique traits useful equipped right gear something mention find quite cool worry underfeeding companions lower morale also base upgrades affect companions quality life difficulty settings dont really much apart increase amount enemies health also isnt really reward playing higher difficulty either seen good bad thing weapons game arent really interesting use apart energy weapons unlock later quite lot bugs game well lack polish places enough ruin experience whole blast playing game basically replaced life days highly recommend game got game cheap easily worth full price
idea fun looting asset flipped housing killing least threatening enemies ever seen video game going building base since thats extent content game offers buy game seriously dont waste money unfinished dev keeps adding new features instead polishing base game shouldnt anywhere near asking price wouldnt spend anything wait full release dont bother
surprisingly really good basically multiplayer minecraft stalker game
prefer original game still moments definitely worth price though mainly nice look apart youre getting chased hideous monster
game good flaws puzzles sometimes way uncomprehending even since hints objectives game whatsoever sometimes figure eventually cheat youtube thing nothing like promised earlier trailers alphas really disappointing finally really buggy npcs really brain dead makes zero threat times patrol rooms makes really hard move picked less australian dollars fun silly little horror puzzle game definitely recommend price purchased
strongly advise game feels way incomplete even alpha wait updates buy
literal masterpiece wasnt lot bugs polish second half game already know im replaying narrative great game play great likely best game ever played yeah game kinda slopes chapters ending makes worth likely end actually caring majority characters overhear conversations makes things feel real story really emotionally captivating might like game depending kind person like survival horror story rich games youll love
furry youtube man told play game bought
game isnt good
game really good say sword play quite methodical clunky basically trading hits till someone dies theres also huge issue crashing game fixed putting command novid mapbackground none games launch options game quite enjoyable also mention whole atmosphere game really eerie love
played game little hour personal opinion game nice eyes thats introduction way lengthy controller limited options cant change controls sensitivity thats basically extent controls keyboard controls fine though dialogue quite mundane listen thing applies cut scenes im sure game would good exploration game id say isnt really much freedom quests lack choices make id recommend invest money better game game isnt bad dont enjoy
really hate fallout conversations seem artificial story really uninteresting lore changed previous games adding need fusion cores use power armour least favourite addition easily fixed using mod cant get achievements mods enabled fixed using another mod dialogue interface really really bad isnt singular character give fk zero motives game entire thing seems uninspired even vats ruined game gun play sucks ammo hard find ill probably eventually finish game love fallout series seriously even fallout unironically enjoyable edit game play exploration enjoyable thing aspects love loathe also every single achievement hidden tf meant game without knowing complete achievements
game fun long periods time gets really repetitive hours
game good yet generic first person mode needs lot improvement animations plain goofy also graphics arent nothing rave game potential really good
stealth system right sucks love aesthetic enemies style
bought game release wheres refund
literally worst toxic community really unfair die someone life spawn literally gain nothing killing fun amusement cant counter playing minutes crafted axe game probably good repetitive task hours hours big group people play also game nothing original competition online pvp survival games similar also mention game many performance issues hard crashes unacceptable fully released title get game friends willing enough spend hours building base without getting killed spawn
game great fun sceptical due negative reviews game quite good option hunger thirst play without way easy find food resources isnt point developers work brings another thing needs work game needs fast travel system map far large drive around also another thing needs work swimming cant swim damages touch water minor issues experienced game really enjoyable loot abandoned buildings covered zombies try best survive night game calls hordes spawns zombies attack every night increases difficulty rewarded health boost every night survive recommend game anyone wants linear survival game kill zombies edit come falling love game best zombie survival played days die dont understand bad reputation game janky alpha build thats still development people hard game really easy learn small learning curb easy pick developers left small things like telling repair weapons go searching steam guides figure game close perfect needs bug fixes multiplayer revival youre sceptical buying game early access title would wait full version game releases
playing game little youre considering picking take consideration list negatives game low spawn rates majority items making difficult craft anything difficult kill enemies janky combat game needs lot work main reason spend hours end initially build base hours hours crafting equipment character yeah understand game intended difficult even lower difficulty settings still repetitive task makes whole lot boring exact thing mention game tries realistic fails crafting recipes dont even make sense unnecessarily hard sake hard little reward game fun dont get wrong wish could muck around bit still want pick go ahead good game dont want go pain maybe wait full release sale fair price

worst halo date dying franchise halo still best halo game date
fun inexpensive game
game far better predecessor weapons missions objectives customisation skill tree okay stealth combat skills make human terminator gadget skills seem useless anyway dont use drone turret weapons good apart unsuppressed ones cant see using stealth seems like enjoyable way play game since enemies delete hp maps good critizism majority maps set desert disappointing games predecessor issue majority maps snow game play amazing apart get bug happens frequently enemies dont die head shots also happens cameras fix empty whole clip either reload save inconvenient graphics great game runs great unlike predecessor last game averaged frames per second lowest settings fcking rx xt like fuck game runs solid frames per second high settings conclusion buggy masterpiece buy like snipers stealth hitman type missions otherwise dont get game ps playing stealth basically makes call duty

although dont particularly like story game game play ahead time weapon jamming option let friendly npcs die save medicine also amazing pc melting fire effects cool touch use actual map navigate around map
left dead good gets old fast basically shoot zombies walking safe room short tasks way dont recommend game story zombie killing nowadays much better zombie games quite good banter mates fk load mods
edit okay story annoying characters mundane missions awfully bad melee combat main story nothing special gets better game gets quite addicting
basically dead island parkour terrible cliche story also awful really tedious melee combat every mission basically chores people dont care also fighting humans even tedious zombies really rewarding time run past everything isnt point really mediocre dont really recommend slightly better dead island reason play bad ass parkour basically first person assassins creed
game okay alot bugs take away immersion havent single mission without bugs
ah go
game isnt styrofoam double cup lean expect watch multiple cut scenes every action sequence
amazing game definitely pick game performance utter garbage unless install dxvk dinput

pretty good game isnt good st outlast still really fun scares done jump scares dont really mind compared outlast theres way
possibly fun far cry every side mission quite fun replayable main story good isnt amazing still liked story every character likeable guns unique satisfying use basically play game like retro games far cry youre missing
game fun many flaws put straight couple bugs kept experiencing npcs would sometimes teleport behind cover kill also npcs would get stuck walls quite often ai laughably dumb turrets ridiculously overpowered kill within seconds every time finish objective walk extraction point gets quite annoying transport walking weird since sniper ghost warrior transport guns quite boring every ar pistol feels apart varying stats also theres quite little weapons choose good things game really fun sniping satisfying pull head shot away skill points really fking overpowered fun use missions feel like hitman really like graphics really nice recommend game like stealth sniping well stealth going loud game um good decision
really fun game mess around story pretty good ending huge disappointment also missions fun game play good
get game second booted story experienced multiple bugs fixed fixed could actually play game crashes finally got story experienced multiple bugs ai audio favour dont get game
game really bad played games got different hackers games also fun little fortnite kids trying trick shot whats poppin montage
small fun game complete short tasks good game pass time pretty fun mobile game though
really fun game kinda bad want scare though didnt get scared throughout whole game
outlast great atmosphere really compelling story simplistic real horror takes place outlast could actually happen makes scary fact based real life events add really good score really adds lot value game implies main character feeling without would really take away horror terms game play people may like think fact youre completely incapable defending variants option run hide really makes feel vulnerable without feeling game wouldnt work anywhere near well fact id go far saying wouldnt success without anyone playing first time seriously recommend playing nightmare difficulty think definitive way playing game normal difficulty takes lot away horror since quite hard die nightmare makes enemies improved sense hearing inflict damage run faster makes actual challenge escape encounter wish wouldve played nightmare difficulty first play also id recommend downloadable content replaying times least noticed many new things didnt initially pick first couple times havent already played outlast love everything horror strongly recommend dont think youll regret also make sure change pants case soil sure first played
liked look game ever since came never got due everyone slamming game unlikable characters bad story bugs bad npcs decided pick really cheap dont regret everything bad game still game play really fun think cool make pistol full auto smg turning ar grenade launcher also game quite alot tasks game probably take fully complete one major downside though game runs awfully amd gpus get frames per second lowest graphics rx xt drops sometimes busy areas
great story amazing game play graphics arent amazingly good still look good due cartoon art style also sound like psycho really satisfying slicing limb clean enemy
game fun party game objective either kill councillors jason escape jason proximity voice chat makes game though many funny moments playing jason councillor really fun needs games like sequel game
amazing story amazing gameplay main story hours long got game pretty good price
completed game everything offer including downloadable content say game really addicting entire game essentially stealing houses pawning items selling online dismantling cars jewellery hacking devices money collect spend equipment make stealing items easier essentially entire game story along contracts makes fun think shame developers didnt make many contracts though game levelling meet level skill requirement complete contract think lack voice acting also missed opportunity really liked character vinny hes voice phone characters meet wouldve nice mechanics wouldve also nice well way counter caught tenants notice door opened walking seen guard police instantly killed arent repercussions load last checkpoint continue etc hope see new additions well improvements sequel comes taking everything consideration game worth money really fun even short comings
genuinely hate game eh okay ig
good game wish told missions located instead roaming around looking honestly much say game fun unique anything special
literally worst game tutorial find everything game gets frames per second lowest settings decent graphics card basically need rtx ti run buy game unless want laugh bad everything game

far really good fan story big fan invasions thats going evolve season season game hooked fighting games makes want commit get properly good eventually main issues far ermac quanchi kombat pass despite already main story fightable complete enemies dont get wait abrupt frames per second cutscenes transitions major jarring going half smoothness dont understand gets locked especially theres unofficial patch remove frames per second lock nothing wrong seems happen denuvo also likely doesnt help inconvenient stutters please remove bad tekken bad mk shrine system kinda ehh least get koins fair rate worst system ever customisation clear theres menu board look goals outfits cosmetics unlock like injustice would nice one last thing add crossplay love god dont leave pc matchmaking pool beg
never thought lord rings game brutal batman arkham combat would amazingly satisfying play really entertaining play runs really well system nemesis system quite unique feels like actually build army orcs graphically game still holds extremely well times looking better good amount games coming right art direction especially main factor orcs world blends together really nicely models highly detailed also sound design game good drop onto enemy height feels like hear bones crushed sword slashes hit really hard voice acting well quite good everyone good job think issues game slave side missions get bit repetitive although theyre least different play prerendered cutscenes locked frames per second quite jarring look worse game dont match colours quite jarring change especially theyre sudden frequent game crashing decent amount times although likely end overclock liking game
takes mods get working todays standards yeah good playthrough get bit repetitive junos relationship starkiller feels really forced sam witners performance still good hes given take minutes get game run frames per second add physics fix file youll likely enjoy remember playing psp back day nice trip memory lane also boss battles fun never understand devs wanting euphoria physics engine end ragdolling fights cant anything tank hits die endings pretty good kill palpatine let somehow return later go vader bad ending really grim get crushed ship metal armour gets grafted flesh vocals really dark think painful sam witners shout choose ending shows good hes good darth maul shows
crash counter game absolutely incredible pc port bad even miserable play normally wouldnt recommend right gets fixed ill update review hours gameplay minutes playtime spent building shader cache alone experienced crash lot drops frames per second often hovering around frames per second mix mediumhigh settings recommended specs im also playing dlss dont dare imagine runs like without crutch patch came today th march improved things bit im glad theyre updating quickly cant bothered waiting long actual version come im getting really tired whole releasing game state fixing later release game isnt even apart whole live service bs
fantastic reimagining halflife source engine dont talk halflife source made much passion made fans fans voice acting holds quite well fits characters like eli vance better fit story id still recommend original game anyone going first time still definitely something people take look doubt
whilst exceptional remake extremely loved pains cant recommend right amount cpu stuttering related issues matter specs likely caused awful bandaid fix denuvo anti theft developers choose use awful fix dont understand game runs awfully becomes stuttery mess times cant say buy right either mod fix releases ea nice enough remove
hi friendnamehere check game innovative shooter played years
didnt really get hooked game like first one sunk hundreds hours first game xbox came came back downloadable content especially following free content updates gameplay movement felt really fluid game legit scary night felt like superhero levelled got skill dying light play watch feels like upgrade areas downgrade lot others really sad really excited one stuff like climbing parkour feel nearly satisfying first game turnoff big portion game enemies especially dumb healthbar trend games seem following feels like mobile game even close original put side side glance graphics performance also kinda eh areas really good others pretty bad maybe ill come back game future youre expecting stuff nearly satisfying cool first game really wouldnt recommend shame
decent game improved gameplay features upon first especially graphical improvement story though really confusing youre paying attention school flashbacks speaking really ruined flow gameplay lot amount hit kill enemies especially annoying respawns put right next said enemy matter dying finally escape blakes voice actor decent although constant swearing didnt seem needed see something scary takes away players reaction final scene though great blake trying cope fact wife died gone completely insane left alone child isnt overall decent game innovation welcomed flow gameplay story needs improved upcoming game
great campaign one favourite favourite frames per second game time sadly multiplayer neglected overran hackers keep ddosing servers wan na play get northstar client github really easy install made community constantly adds new game modes anti cheat security custom servers browser everything unlocked
aside apparent bugs never got fixed case beat game hard got achievement beat old school get achievement looks dumb like cutscenes fast forwarding like parking garage assets loading cutscenes properly game amazing gunplay gameplay basically makes game ridiculously fun replayable hunt golden gun collectables nice thing side doesnt take away missions usually plain sight glance away although sometimes might take minute get fully search place moving whilst annoying cutscenes mostly unskippable worst usually arent long get thrown right back shooting people anyway would definitely recommend especially cheap right
thought game great lot fun managed beat inferno mode well two issues though games length short doubt cut many areas fights etc game one point able beat game three times day final nemesis boss fight nightmare inferno absolute get hit one attacks drum roll attack swipe consider dead spam space bar
beaten portal perfect sequel opinion chel returns main character well glados new character wheatly start back facility years events portal memories lost events first game meet wheatly agrees help get freedom world adventure begins wont spoil game youre like able get game twists turns game fantastic end brilliant well final song new main menu screen like finished first game game brilliant enjoyed first game youll love one well
great simplistic program really ease people animation art theyve gotten grips controls although takes lot effort throw due lack proper tutorials properly explain things steam workshop sites great getting assets although keyword specific careful dont immediately find youre looking render tech still holds pretty well make damn impressive posters even day right lighting models bit touching something like photoshop seen lot friends artists create really good stuff would make think source engine first rather something else although really picky settings stuff complaints would fact based older version source engine seen update years happening crashing performance issues come challenge especially youre looking asset lists pick something add scene extremely painful time got program moving blender lot higher quality opportunities come great managed make neat posters mess around things didnt think would really good messing around learning different things art conclusion youre getting art dont know start id definitely recommend using sfm go see starters still holds pretty well remember ctrl extremely regularly

good absolutely revolutionary game inspired changed landscape gaming formula many games still follow exactly today challenging platforming controls crisp catchy tune probably seen video game anthem power mechanics unique enemies varied movement giving decent challenge platformer turning balls balls using balls kill balls creative made combat deeper character models environment bold made easy see stomping foes feel satisfying bad felt amount lives little starting game punishing norm difficulty back gaming
mom wife give bohemia
hours
pathfinding pretty interesting get kill natives im fun
gmods pretty fun
added black people
flies theyre coming inside walls theyre trying steal banking info wont let get wont let get wont let get walls cry wails damned beckon listen ears open cries needy salty
game fun easy get lost exploring side quests meeting interesting npcs hours yet go beyond nd main mission
fine feels sparse many ways maps feel significantly less substantial scale density maps small feel barren lot life two seven missions map alternative paths still map also game way easy partly enemy density much less never feel overwhelmed feel need deliberate fire rifle also lot starting areas mission give strong vantage point easily kill enemies spot spawn one mission kill main target starting area like would recommend game score everyone says downloadable content much feels way
manual save youd think would autosave wiping area enemies doesnt even going waste time game doesnt respect players time
reason getting revived doesnt remove death record less incentive wanting revived removing team ticket leave match early marks death record even never died well every even get revived brain dead game design actively discourages revives entirely possible care personal performance play objective though developers seem think kinds people dont matter actively punishing hiding one stat midgame would care people getting pubstomped going leave regardless gave extra incentive update since latest update every considered death even get revived never leave match somehow managed make downs feel even worse already hides downsdeaths midgame wait till postmatch scoreboard see badly great job devs actively discouraging anyone cares well
random frame drops single digits frames per second every minutes gpu utilization ridiculous started happening latest update shouldnt kinds issues bad ti medium settings actually unplayable
fun content game constantly throwing matches team losing hardpoint tdm nothing like losing games row join games progress chance flipping odds favor dont problem sbmm theory supposed balance winloss ratio win lose amount matches except game win matches lose matches row win another lose matches make play time huge waste time also crash due directx bug devs seemingly never resolved since release counts loss game punishes technical ineptitude thats fun
game wont launch crashes start amount trouble shooting helped gotten past waste money
graphics good mobility smooth combat fun mission design uninspired would wait sale
bethesda rpg space sim thats cup tea youve come right place
someone whos never played saints row franchise harmless open world action game enough going warrant initial launch price youre concerned whether stands fine
lot fun even youre fan harry potter
eager get playing excellent base game boy start short length ridiculous difficulty spike end weapons suddenly become ineffective end making final boss fight needlessly difficult also last save checkpoint starting outside base instead front final boss dont quit beating boss else youll lose much progress
game goes frames per second every seconds seconds almost unplayable k ti shouldnt performance problems alas
game fun
dealing video settings pain ass game breaks trying tab respectful time randomly play different monitors instead one set could pc review reflect experience im game
game hours long played hours counting amount time spent original xbox version life also game phenomenal
fun even performance isnt ideal
great introduction story newcomers solid companion piece owners original
fun game constant crashing
skirmish battles piss annoying frustrating gameplay component whoever designed bastion boss platforming section never design game ever literally hardest fight involves platforming floor breaks get struck lightning thought playing rpg crash bandicoot team member ai absurdly stupid expert expect die boss fights within first seconds minute fastest seen die first boss attack move absolutely self preservation esp charge high damage aoe instead run away
long game still havent beaten want lot bang buck definitely reliable purchase remains charming every time return
frustrating
online component keeps disconnecting makes annoyance egregious takes forever disconnect players monsters running place solid minutes booting single player version mission previously trying coop otherwise game fine though unforgiving newcomers prepared lot homework via youtube google game doesnt good job explaining minutia many working parts also many crashes due error graphics cards nothing outdated drivers game lock give error window graphics crash hasnt fix since game first came user remedy alleviated issues baffling imagine farming map research points minutes game crash thus work goes waste load

solid survival horror game never played original cant comment differences best part game definitely atmosphere without problems core story objective well thought constantly bring new interesting things characters encounter greatly portrayed interactions best part story sometimes even ship feel like character interact amounts atmosphere oozes enhanced great audiovisual presentation technical problems notable traversal stutter unfortunately praise cant said gameplay time bring anything new even new enemy variants lots encounters feel puzzles often boiled bring battery push button apart good ones biggest problem interesting alien marker lore presented clearly hard follow paired lackluster ending hurts story lot making seem way simpler would say whole th chapter could entirely skipped last boss fight nothing would change conclusion liked time spent would recommend fans genre expectations right dont expect anything like regarding remake going satisfied
unique sim like experience great play friends even early access
great survival horror experience modernized
great trip memory lane game still really great think gameplay graphics hold well rough edges end game nothing bad aspects makes good indiana jones story like uncharted favor play one often goes sale dirty cheap
unique game came gameplay similar resident evil right place story interesting plays familiar concepts feels really fresh sometimes story much background left wonder hell going right find answers need lot reading puzzle piecing together might everyone like presentation world characters side characters really weak advice lot reading online story doesnt matter much playing game might find really interesting things might missed playing gameplay solid nothing groundbreaking enough entertain runtime game roughly hours recommended interesting entertaining game
played control alan wake liked going like one well story great main characters interesting plot keeps hooked whole game side characters weaker doesnt matter much lot time dedicated gameplay good better alan wake worse control combat fun enemies really bullet sponges sections could use combat fighting gon na walking listening dialogue even close look like tv show thats interactive rather game going enjoy far sure

great
story game really great may follow usual formulas justify gameplay elements brimming great ideas actually couple stories become part game love world feels like centered around main character interesting characters stories bosses reminiscent dark souls dont mind think great narrative tool helps make world feel alive gameplay best summarised metroidvania close salt sanctuary games type progression world walled behind movement abilities need acquire progress next stages problem game difference first second playthrough think second playthrough experience far better first one difference knowledge previous playthrough order go make huge difference advise follow order locations guide also one one last thing choose one weapon upgrade upgrade one highest level upgrading multiple ones extent screw playthrough quite lot would wish everyone first maybe playthrough great second
think game suffers lot last one trilogy kind expect sequel bigger better even innovative predecessor game bigger rise think wrong kind way fills map lots collectibles opinion uninteresting dont give enough reward finding resources find spent upgrade weapons outfits boost weapons combat would fine game little combat feels kind pointless least amount combat new trilogy think like tombs crypts fun sidewalk main mission think rest collectibles break pacing much even go hub area tons collectibles side missions side missions expect tomb raider hub area opinion boring worth time give little reward useful mentioned good skip collectibles side missions altogether problem getting main game deluxe edition best weapons outfits start dont worry anything comes better say story gameplay better rise stories either even shadow bit weaker gameplay nearly like could huge expansion risegameplay wise opinion stories gone downhill going onward definitely hard set bar really high making something better hard task dont blame think fan series definitely worth playing get tomb raider fun want dont high expectations
get table really recommend game playing really see lot people consider best one series breath fresh air ideas regular zombies featured first games setting village really great parts work well second area castle good lacks character atmosphere village still great remind us parts first game problem game best summarize rd major area action packed lacks character opinion really weak connection story game really suit another laboratory army stronghold like seen many games least shortest three areas mentioned get showcases regarding survival horror lean action say didnt mind corniness dialogues think game selfaware make fun times problem downside game port quite lot quick time events scattered throughout require precise timing would ok time react amount button pressing wasnt tied frames per second playing game frames per second makes quick time events downright impossible really hard go back menu switch load game lose progress couple times annoying really complain go ahead play enjoy ps would really like see game coud leaned fully village cult side kind got new regarding curious offer
review resident evil including resident evil resistance feel like hard talk game without mentioning comparing resident evil however doubleedged sword looks runs plays sounds good like regarding perfect areas different form regarding action oriented linear good makes different interesting way however game extremely short low replay value compared regarding first run collecting things could took hours second run took hours complete start finish game decision moments like original two alternative campaign choices like regarding compared think big downloadable content made choices like original maybe content aside get good price think enjoyed previous similar games absolutely worth playing
playing max payne backtoback really shows different game originals released nearly decade nd one destined different least way coming different era gaming cover shooter featuring bullet time pixel precise accuracy many game cinematics nearly opposite first one still long way away second one nearly thing share max character used think best look continuing previous two games rather modern take idea max payne story looking max payne game game featuring max payne think really lot enjoy game play polished satisfying soundtrack best entire series story interesting enough keep engaged run time say one thing really sells max character game performance capture done voice actor james mccaffrey ask yes miss comic book panels james really wonders screen think liked first two definitely worth playing little sad probably never see continuation story
playing max payne back back really shows huge step first second game everything improved graphics gameplay story voice acting gameplay things didnt like first one exceptionally better overall product feels much polished first playthrough enjoyed much bonus dont install rd party patches get game running without problems new systems would recommend anybody interested rd person shooter good story

liked first game youre almost guaranteed like one similar everything little better said plenty bugs dont play main story come across main story also im sure first giant patch released lot issues get fixed arent game breaking anyway like first game isnt everyone character takes time level bad things initially game relatively slow paced times filled exposition parts even dont like like parts dont play henry youre looking immersed medieval world life moves bit slowly repetitive task away improving skills become tank game played first game found enjoyment thought quests really lame one takes loved first game likely gets rid didnt put hours im sure easily put another hours theres third chapter henrys story ill nodoubt get one id hope improvement similar study real budget enjoy games please keep making
played nd game pc bit late party rdr improves game every single way still great game worth playing starts slow theres lots boring missions beginning story gets going many great cinematic moments clearly served inspirations nd game enjoyed rdr couldnt get slow cattle wrangling horse breaking missions early push part game still gem years later still looks great pc especially mod two installed
concept interesting kind psychic detective channel demons end result kinda boring story captivating found skipping dialogue voice acting wooden fighting gets repetitive one rare occasions think game actually long buy special play youve got nothing else worst game ever made ok played maybe min hour sessions due finding tedious
absolute masterpiece late metro franchise remember trying first one years ago never clicking never revisiting recently bought redux games last light remastered essentially blown away game play compelling games held pretty well enjoyed good first two third one compelling beautiful game went openworld feel built really immersive compelling world story drawn world game ways rare visually beautiful strong narrative fun combat really amazing game wish played earlier one best single player games existence
honestly kind blown away redux version game holds well modern titles day storytelling great engine beast ill honest say took actually get game hooked complaint would dream sequences hate games general definitely worth play especially youve tried couldnt get
first critical flawed somewhat outdated looking game terms models animations found quite bugs well heads turning around degrees falling floor clipping walls times things activating game crashed numerous times despite high end hardware takes ages build shaders causing slow connection first minute play skills besides combat based ones mostly dont serve purpose get away upgrading wanted feel bit overpowered well end game upgraded armour combat abilities kitted gun right mods kill hundreds enemies world feels empty isnt much outside main missions supposed big crowded city feels basically abandoned small town sunday vibes said still play fun robocop flaws game still somehow manages fun play isnt greatest game ever fun one especially youre casual side found sad end would probably play follow entries hopefully bit polished
incredibly bored opening bits game found soviet thirst bit weird found prorussian antiukrainian fsb data terms conditions stuff later known latter would never bought begin made stop playing right bat clearly inspired bioshock reminded lot infinite except terrible voice acting world everyone calls comrade clunky pacing reference liked bioshock wolfenstein games saw reviews comparing mainly bought remind good way like wolfenstein unaware irony bioshock without everything makes good opinion dont mind fsb data playing game possibly funds war ukraine playing game inferior inspiration go ahead id rather play bioshock personally
feels clunky fun opening sequence alright graphics quite good story meh definitely good game deadspace enemies kinda predictable walk near vent crack wall know something going pop combat boring hell poorly implemented fighting multiple enemies mess switching weapon pain arse dodge mechanic doesnt feel like works right weapons arent fun use game involves throwing enemies grp glove bashing stick crazy ramp difficulty platform sequence youll know reach really poor choices auto save points causing repurchase upgrades sell loots dozens times cases die fight death scenes animations bit long get annoying real quick manual saves dont work youd expect rather serve alternative checkpoint saves serve almost purpose didnt load manual save test works mostly create chapters replay later want game actually little replayability since theres real variation anything youll stuck seeing cutscenes using weapons using fighting strategies allinall disappointing game given beautiful graphics environments artists created see lot love blood sweat tears went game real shame didnt come together something really amazing id still give definitely engaging games play
good predecessors puzzles tough really fun worthwhile throwback revisiting old friends youre older fan originals enjoyed
honestly probably worst game franchise love games played one sticks feeling half finished theres something fun pacing tier system sudden ramp difficulty adds big nothing uninteresting bullet sponge showdown enemy feels like youve already ravaged still strong dogs appear nowhere harass lob endless projectiles two strong women bosses feels like started developing fun game told hurry along finish evertything race onwards feels honestly meh rushed even map tiny definitely play youre fan deep discount youve nothing better play
quite good first game quite bad everyone says worth play youve nothing better lots fun dont expect deep moving story
pros fun gameplay beautiful setting villains love hate cons many dream sequences cut scenes plot doesnt make sense probably one worst lamest endings gaming still worth playthrough accept outset almost nothing matters youll probably hate ending youll find enlightened year old internet arguing ending deep dont get youre smart disregard ending trash clumsily written game fun regardless
loved original xcom games played time growing first remake arrived wasnt keen really enjoyed game unfortunately xcom isnt fun dont like guerrilla war nature would preferred something like terror deep continuation previous xcom game also dont like kinda feels like previous game didnt matter rescue world first invasion somehow everyone council decided side aliens dont want fight earth based threat people shape shifters want straight fight aliens also dislike events chatty game constant interruptions talking heads couldnt arsed care want play immersed battle music also distracts rather adds atmosphere opinion overall really wanted like game keep loading thinking maybe itll get better dont enjoy like want instead find loading terror deep get xcom fix
fun doom least
saw bad reviews honestly thought must mistaken reality bored game gave hour bad combat system bland characters overly verbose exposition could bothered know care find character enjoyed original game played many similar games including baldurs gate series original sin games lots text game feels completely uninspired feels like big chore make developers play requesting refund got enjoyment game games shouldnt feel like chore
enjoyed played original games back came years late one maybe memories original faded really enjoyed game judging reviews probably underrated game released different thing wasnt overly fond story made little sense youre looking cinematic brain dead balls wall action slog recommend cutscenes exposition bother youre looking carbon copy original games look elsewhere
game truly mixed bag every sense word odd years late game avid adventure game player sierra lucas arts especially story intruiging score good game feels slow short dialog poor voice acting wooden characters mostly unlikeable least cliche strong female knowitall army commander type hard headed german scientist many puzzles frustrating theyre hard many claim rather dont make sense theres little chance anyone would stumble solution intuitively id say fall category would recommend someone wants played game youre thinking playing like felt like good adventure game thought hidden gem missed back day look elsewhere
tried hard like game returned hour hour could never manage hour time wasnt expecting anything particular disappointed got game engine great graphics pretty story isnt compelling combat nemesis system everyone else seems think awesome bored living daylights battles stretch forever tedious affairs roll jump around interrupted whole time new captains giving speeches cool get ready die often especially beginning havent levelled dont know game mostly everything poorly explained game basically assassins creed set mordor fun except isnt reason enemies respawn quickly often making battles dull areas clean dont stay clean making accomplishment feel pointless theres real penalty dying except enemies get tougher gets better upgrade character frankly didnt care anymore game boring thats deadliest videogame sin
good good storytelling unique concept nice soundtrack makes think choices effect real life bad overly dramatic voice acting especially lead character hours weepy teenage melodrama sections go long little choices dont matter feels cinematic long times many minutes interacting game overall life strange good overrated game glaring faults especially final episode didnt quite get emotional kick many others found characters incredibly whiney times voice acting lead character overly emotional everything shaky whispery voice choking yes im im going take high fibre dump eat ba ba bacon eggs played episodes row maybe wouldnt come across annoying played released originally parts going okay get weepy sad call whambulance play game please give game worth playing storytelling interesting concept definitely flaws
im sure agree glowing reviews game receives cant recommend easy short point click adventure game beautiful artwork interesting concept ending bit disappointing got bad ending viewed reason got bad ending thought lowering cage let prisoner actually lowering water let drown thought silly thats less say originality actual game bit overpriced game time
finished game simply bought bought overwhelming hype claiming one best rpgs ever made sadly found pretty much hack slash action rpg sure lots game stuff read world actual gameplay involves little isnt simply bashing armies enemies diablo style okay game could give neutral instead yes id give instead glitchy windows machine gb ram crashed several times even affinity set several quests bugged times textures disappeared lot battle sequences overly long yet challenging patricularly final battle fade part game force continue several times simply got bored clicking enemies death pausing game million times micro manage character sometimes characters stand get bashed head even though give orders nothing original interesting plot game mechanics essentially baldurs gate fighting bugs honestly dont know fuss books game falls far short something like ultima still consider king rpgs even skyrim
really wanted like game tried get several times found unintersting boring really dont understand praise gets people sucks bought games special thinking might similar mass effect emotionally invested characters dont care game world constant respawning hacking gets tedious super fast basically giant slog fest
first started playing mass effect hated finished first game changes jarring levelling works differently controls overhauled found first hour game pretty dull im sure stuck game man glad turns mass effect weaker many areas first one great game yes rpg elements dumbed yes greater focus frames per second elements yes opening chapter bit lame pulls everything together beautifully end makes great entertaining solid entry franchise youre like loved first game hour playing still dont feel like second one stick worth rewarded patience
im part small minority dont think game best series fact dont even think called assassins creed black flag feels like ubisoft started create pirate game halfway decided assassins creed game instead tacked templar related elements played asassins creed brotherhood revalations one familiar lore game enjoyed series wheels came terrible protagonist conor assassins creed feel disjointed disconnected assassin roots somehow games become less less finding history assassins struggle templars individual characters fall organization chance game looks fine naval warfare back expanded upon greatly much makes giant chunk game didnt enjoy aspect give skip combat works well enough game missing something like core game somehow went lost translation dont much care conor edward stealth element almost completely removed game well lesser extent predecessor many cases faced scenario stealth either isnt possible dont time deal game encourages full frontal attacks endlessly counter attack heaps bodies surround perhaps completely separate game different story line could enjoyed assasins creed game say im disappointed especially given extremely hyperbolic reviews read
fan tv series honestly say didnt think game great many people sure laughed times felt lot like interactive episode show personally didnt find funny gameplay compelling others regardless recommend game fans south park many throwbacks episodes fun cant say game felt unfinished rushed experienced one bug graphics audio exactly tv show labeled rpg feels like adventure game rpg elements added think dumbed version something like day tentacle also upgrade character worth play fans tv show youre curious easily offended probably stay clear
let start saying fan tomb raider played original games years ago found boring bought title bored feeling nostalgic special mention anything slightly negative bias game expecting suck boy wrong tomb raider properly reboots franchise larger life adventure filled fun environments explore lot action packed sequences game clearly built console comes across number qtes appear throughout stomach wholeheartedly recommend tomb raider entertaining experience vein uncharted series graphics surprisingly good voice acting reasonably solid id estimate average person would get hours play time
gamer years one best games ever played interesting characters captivating story intuitive creative gameplay mechanics might like watercolour look graphics voice acting flat times game manages balance everything perfectly got hours play taking stealth approach game exploring world rush objective objective might finish half go achievements upgrades youll probably finish twice whether take hours finish game though gotten moneys worth

learn russian language
truly forward thinking game time lot brinks ideas could work modern era put back together correctly lot ideas brink successfully implemented games like battlefield overwatch shame didnt get winning formula perfected imagine working well free play games seasonal content battle passes
like tarkov find missing features tarkov playing said game lot different things like see lot potential hope thrives hope gets much deeper mechanics hopefully mini building mechanics like buildable stash locker wild could compromised found also hope events pit factions maybe larger scale battles nice see fellow faction players around thing talking asking help easy squad game feels lively extractions actually make sense either walk back get chopper instead looking little crack wall random window door
game actually launch anymore make game duct tape prayer please dont come back years later peel tape stuff unwanted crap installing game fixing game ridiculous

much stable great deal content pretty presentation wanting return original find one massively improves got ta wait maps get play official servers thanks abysmal policy releasing enough servers force player base rent partnered deal one sole provider profit isnt definition monopoly nonetheless good game core
great game needed love time never even attempted release ps xone
gim titanfall titanfall one two combined remaster content one place
dont know pulled scenes trailer ingame played games earliest closed backer test barely changed crashes slightly less pay single penny play test garbage clearly wont hire anyone one thing game going zombie horde actually dense almost dense actually explore overreaction earlier complaints enough zombies gunplay melee combat functional almost every feature expected quality life interaction doa guys clearly cant figure vehicles take relegate us smaller map functionally simpler bicycles figure waiting two years say thanks immoral choice enforce nda us private backers yes massively upset group people scammed cgi faked gameplay trailers get point almost nothing made game originally exciting brought table start die middle nowhere inside horde usuable vehicles nearby glitching place dont even know supposed experience game servers dead due people crashing giving come back another years might working
game blast blew away literally fun fast paced mech shooter great customisation fairly difficult bosses story multiple choices endings worth replay two definitely worth full price
still run badly stutter long launch genuinely hard time running frames per second low settings mid settings thrashes badly stutters constantly also exclusive fullscreen internal res slider pain play k tv keep desktop resolution p truly disappointed great story stuck within abysmal port guess one need look forward playing higher quality two three gpu generations later
coming long time player game various iterations always fun survival roleplaying buddies exploring random gen maps solid base building defending mechanics think devs hit sweet spot latest update pvp servers ok cheaters game really isnt built around pvp balancing thats game shines really shines always amazing randomly generated maps increasing difficulty various vehicles goodies patient players isnt minecraft zombies much game made lasting friendships memories even earliest buggiest builds dont dissuaded statement solid game solo players mostly like play days think guys add permadeath toggle go gold youve done try port consoles add crossplay amongst visual updates bug fixes swear game solid staple years come maybe decades keep refining mod support also new intro sexy give devs love people long road faithful game earned full price tag
getting thumbs game crashes constantly ubisoft keep petty adding achievements trading cards steam ubisoft connect never keeping signed generally unreliable game actually pretty fun like looty shootys quite lot game modes variety going even permadeath love game play solid much streamlined first entry comparison story meh lots people sitting around telling go save world one man army crying people country lost wont particularly attach characters maybe dispatch guy generally wont shut hell nonsense enemy movements spare bits story usually briefing enemies actions mission pretty much point little sprinkles humour fact cutscenes short back story audio logs scattered around open world stories look sequential order randomly dotted around think game needed big bad villian focus story one really bad guy took dc spend whole game focusing liberate map rather multiple boring stereotypical factions disjointed map like got
absolutely amazing think devs try expand studio continue developing game would support battle pass system game got say map creator content return perfect price point game could sink lot time thanks modes maps
bit closer battlefield previous entries environmental disasters make fun come back portal mode offers content bf bad company making good buy whether want experience wacky new gadgets maps relax lobbies nostalgic maps
dont really understand developers release half short game drip feed rest fortnightly updates course months still short game adding boss superficial toy doesnt want make come back every week makes want dodge game year two rest content see people think new building backpack mechanics cool clearly early prototype vr version release year two stimulate finances next release overall impressed feels like game clunkier gameplay slightly better graphics worse optimisation kind ok companion system liked first game indie point view unique well done around block better funding talent feels like took safe option remaking first game ideas came hindsight next game grandsons forest dont think ill buying final verdict maybe wait vr super fan first game want revamped mechanics
took year finally turned boat around nice updates recently keep good work
honest opinion joking cods played since classics bad save black ops zombies one genuinely first non black ops cod enjoyed since playing high school warzone slightly better previous one miss verdansk cheating virtually non existent seen nearly hours campaign actually pretty solid would good time dmz warzone dont want pay mw although feel like campaign coop stuff actually worth investment time dmz actually good yes hundreds hours tarkov think dmz also earn place casual players clear missions progressions sorts earn putting time dying game plea another squad adopt disguise solo players play stealthily although difficult get would like see added store personally playing dmz honestly think cod could translate well transitioned open world coop game coop campaign missions spec ops raids war zone dmz rolled one imagine example full coop experience playing member ghost squad mission player defined role objective advance story like gta online heists could played different role different conditions earn currency upgrades perks killstreaks keep replayability fresh give player agency advance progression story

intially like game think thats mostly understand wants really lay experience pre determined waves ai enemies threaten king build defences workers study enemies defences retaliate counter units add waves help shop buy cosmetic ui customisations including avatar cards traded clan upgrades end repeatable purchase microtransaction currency nice touch many games wont let actually earn currencies meaning dedicated players stock currency later battlepass game weekly challenge modes open tourneys earn stuff functionally game works fine crashes problems yet neat game though takes little learn play fairly steep learning curve popular ranked mode art style nice slightly cartoonish pay win elements cheesy bonuses carry matches every match every player start choices upgrades game receives semi frequent updates adding new units balances would like see map themeslocations like volcano desert music loading screens repetative grinding multiplayer modes wacky snaking maps would cool like tower defence games like mobile autobattlermoba lane attacker type hybrid game command whole lot attention play spend time waiting units make b fairly generous timers upgrading waves require fair bit strategy cooperation one player underperforming sending units wrong time sink game fast
cant wait see go changes made remake whole remake solid theres hours beautiful cutscenes side stuff keep occupied
fun time traveling story witness lots key moments across whole franchise game modes like card battling minigame mega boss raids real game training mission broken combo required completion
game dead get medium hard friend bots randoms anything higher everything else dead story ok pretty solid ld clone go play instead could potentially fun players dedicated grinding choosing right perks sense almost turns mmo like ultimately thats devs went wrong game swear could x better competative story mode
dark souls big open world favour grab buddy seamless coop mod use horses dont disconnect every little thing surprisingly stable base game review stays negative older games multiplayer back

probably one greatest games ever made well written story presented comic book style cutscenes much fun dive around corners slow motion blast enemies shotgun lots subtle details hidden level funny interesting non player character dialogue great soundtrack ambient background noises go game recommendation must install soundpatch fix audio issues takes minutes detailed guides steam guide section well worth
boring story uninteresting car moves slow missions far away enough enemies fun even sale highly dont recommend

zombies parking lot thats cant get achievements first try bad video games
game like exist nuke certain country twice feels like ninja gaiden knock enjoy kind games youll like
bad reviews game propaganda great game got full version downloadable content steam sale well worth fan dead rising games steam changed voice actor frank youll get used quickly
game actually cured cancer depression
worth playing finishing previous titles frank wests point view events dead rising significant changes story weapon customization map expansion new enemies survivors added camera function like original game adds new level gameplay didnt read
huge improvement dead rising regarding controls game weapon customization ai survivor functionality greatly improved storyrich game like first one multiple endings
highly recommend love storyrich zombie games fan zombie movies general also like game game almost years old controls clunky sometimes frustrating dodge rolling controls customized definitely worth picking even full price
although considered spinoff game far cry series one best storymode campaigns whole series along fc fcnewdawn unique gameplay like far cry game without guns obviously game set bc modern languages either must read translated captions language lots nudity one last wenja members surviving udam cannibal group izila sun walker group world called oros point game defeat groups save group
least memorable far cry game series id recommend content far cry far cry newdawn far cry primal game far cry games great general story missions gameplay one isnt good others sale worth getting sure
dont get game unless already finished far cry wont understand story one mission game like serial killer simulator story really good villains make game recommend far cry games
played every cod available steam far best ww based cod campaign exists campaign includes russia england us side war germany japan missions unlike cod world war missions make feel like really ww especially us campaign gets intense dday mission fan ww simulator games would love version cod game sounds sound effects enemy noise bullet shots cod modern warfare gunsanimations cod world war issues bugs graphics surprisingly good old game movie credits also worth watching
set million years smooth gameplay awesome graphics really nice scenery zombies mode also well done iw game complaints campaign many spaceship flying missions opposed ground shooting long boring unskippable cutscenes uninteresting characters many females god save us military many women also cod tries normalize robot friendships bonding ai trying make feel emotions robots lame
definition classic video game
good stand alone game cod series awful cliffhanger ending still bad
great sequel modern warfare graphic campaign lots killing civilians
worst modern warfare series still bad game campaign pretty good
classic ww frames per second isnt cup tea probably best campaign cod series
dont understand cod obsession ripping limbs main character campaign short extremely boring first game ending campaign gets pretty good worth wait moral campaign dont trust kevin spacey
awful campaign game trash
worth getting great campaign soundtrack version cod offers best nazi zombie game cod game lots secret easter eggs campaign zombies mode
awful nothing previous black ops titles campaign trash mission limbs ripped given ptsd life
best cod campaign cod game basically ww movie play zombie mode game great graphics incredible
classic game started nazi zombies epic campaign great soundtrack
game works call duty installed otherwise wont work attempt veteran mode far difficult cod campaign existence play campaigns usa uk russia vs germany even hardened difficulty took hours beat difficult missions
definitely worth getting lengthy campaign includes usa united kingdoms russia storylines blend together well decent amount weapon options youve enjoyed playing cod world war youll problem getting game gun models reload animations exactly games different story modes good music also definitely fitting theme ww way censorship regarding nazi symbols fact shown everywhere game missions thats something offends youve warned accurate history downside game technical difficulties launching game doesnt work unless ctrlaltdelete start task manager force close cod game launch second try thats consistent fix problem technical issue closing game steam still thinks game open adding fake hours playtime since steam thinks game still playing couldnt play games without restarting computer entirely restarted steam would still think playing cod pretty small issues pretty annoying however consistent solution issues besides id definitely recommend game anyone enjoys world war frames per second games

dont normally buy play early access games made exception one based positive reviews praise received certainly dont regret totally love aesthetics game still fun hours believe content added game return often
different game doom thats sure platforming caught guard took quite time get along died many times falling killed demons yet actually enjoy fun many secret areas show automap yet actually getting isnt always easy impossible either tho disappointed low ammo storage even fully upgraded time learnt deal chainsaw obvious answer along using arsenal thats getting us main complaint doesnt work well necessity use specific weapons specific demons kinda destroys doomguys creativity story lore really love read codex entries watched youtube theories videos hope expand upcoming dlcs true game somewhat dumbed legal ingame cheats werent necessary tbh nobody forces use campaign little short liking leets hope dlcs cover well dont care multiplayer rating overall liked im glad wasnt simple copy many people would like seems
